"He asked him sharply: ""Why do you stand there gaping?"
why do you make so much noise?
"""I am very middling,"" replied the Lion, ""but why do you stand without?"
One day an old hound said to him: Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself?
"The Vine addressed him and said: ""Why do you thus injure me without a cause, and crop my leaves?"
Is there no young grass left?
"The Crab and Its Mother  A Crab said to her son, ""Why do you walk so one-sided, my child?"
"The Man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said, ""Why?"
"At that moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: ""Why is there such a scarcity of fodder?"
"The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, ""Why do you hurt me so, Mistress?"
What weight can my blood add to the wool?
"my son, which of the gods do you think will pity you?"
what shall I do to you?
"The Fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life: ""O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am I worth?"
"The bird entreated earnestly for his life: ""What would you do without me when next you spread your nets?"
"But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: ""If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn?"
"The Lion said, ""Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division?"
"He appealed to the Ass to fly with him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal lazily replied, ""Why should I, pray?"
"The Wolves and the Sheepdogs  The Wolves thus addressed the Sheepdogs: ""Why should you, who are like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us, and live with us as brothers should?"
"If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard?"
For in what does your strength consist?
Why do you not go faster?
"The Governor then called a public assembly and addressed the citizens: ""Of what folly have you been guilty?"
"Mercury soon appeared and said to him, ""O thou most base fellow?"
"The Wolf and the Lion  Roaming by the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, ""Why should I, being of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion?"
what have you done?
"A Sparrow upbraided her and said, ""Where now is thy remarkable swiftness of foot?"
"The poor beast replied, not without a touch of reason: ""Why do you ask me?"
What respect is shown to old age in these days?
Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk?
"To which the Lion jeeringly replied, ""It was righteously yours, eh?"
"Jupiter replied, ""Why do you blame me without a cause?"
"Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, ""Do you see that little buzzing insect?"
"Will not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life?"
"Shall we not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon what is right?"
What sort of goods would one call good in themselves?
"Is it those that are pursued even when isolated from others, such as intelligence, sight, and certain pleasures and honours?"
Or is nothing other than the Idea of good good in itself?
But what then do we mean by the good?
"Are goods one, then, by being derived from one good or by all contributing to one good, or are they rather one by analogy?"
What then is the good of each?
"Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner certain functions or activities, and has man none?"
Is he born without a function?
"Or as eye, hand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has a function, may one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from all these?"
What then can this be?
"   Must no one at all, then, be called happy while he lives; must we, as Solon says, see the end?"
"Even if we are to lay down this doctrine, is it also the case that a man is happy when he is dead?"
"Or is not this quite absurd, especially for us who say that happiness is an activity?"
Or is this keeping pace with his fortunes quite wrong?
"When then should we not say that he is happy who is active in accordance with complete virtue and is sufficiently equipped with external goods, not for some chance period but throughout a complete life?"
Or must we add 'and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his life'?
Or is this not true even of the arts?
"What sort of acts, then, should be called compulsory?"
"Now of all of these no one could be ignorant unless he were mad, and evidently also he could not be ignorant of the agent; for how could he not know himself?"
"For in the first place, on that showing none of the other animals will act voluntarily, nor will children; and secondly, is it meant that we do not do voluntarily any of the acts that are due to appetite or anger, or that we do the noble acts voluntarily and the base acts involuntarily?"
"Is not this absurd, when one and the same thing is the cause?"
"Again, what is the difference in respect of involuntariness between errors committed upon calculation and those committed in anger?"
"What, then, or what kind of thing is it, since it is none of the things we have mentioned?"
"Is it, then, what has been decided on by previous deliberation?"
"   Do we deliberate about everything, and is everything a possible subject of deliberation, or is deliberation impossible about some things?"
"If these consequences are unpleasing, are we to say that absolutely and in truth the good is the object of wish, but for each person the apparent good; that that which is in truth an object of wish is an object of wish to the good man, while any chance thing may be so the bad man, as in the case of bodies also the things that are in truth wholesome are wholesome for bodies which are in good condition, while for those that are diseased other things are wholesome- or bitter or sweet or hot or heavy, and so on; since the good man judges each class of things rightly, and in each the truth appears to him?"
"If this is true, then, how will virtue be more voluntary than vice?"
"With what sort of terrible things, then, is the brave man concerned?"
"In what circumstances, then?"
And the man whose deserts are great would seem most unduly humble; for what would he have done if they had been less?
"And it would be most unbecoming for a proud man to fly from danger, swinging his arms by his sides, or to wrong another; for to what end should he do disgraceful acts, he to whom nothing is great?"
"Now should we define the man who jokes well by his saying what is not unbecoming to a well-bred man, or by his not giving pain, or even giving delight, to the hearer?"
"Or is the latter definition, at any rate, itself indefinite, since different things are hateful or pleasant to different people?"
"Were you both willing, or unwilling both?"
"Is it truly possible to be willingly treated unjustly, or is all suffering of injustice the contrary involuntary, as all unjust action is voluntary?"
"And is all suffering of injustice of the latter kind or else all of the former, or is it sometimes voluntary, sometimes involuntary?"
"Or is our definition incorrect; must we to 'harming another, with knowledge both of the person acted on, of the instrument, and of the manner' add 'contrary to the wish of the person acted on'?"
Or does this statement too need qualification?
But towards whom?
"Now knowing what is good for oneself will be one kind of knowledge, but it is very different from the other kinds; and the man who knows and concerns himself with his own interests is thought to have practical wisdom, while politicians are thought to be busybodies; hence the word of Euripides,   But how could I be wise, who might at ease,  Numbered among the army's multitude,  Have had an equal share?"
"It is because the objects of mathematics exist by abstraction, while the first principles of these other subjects come from experience, and because young men have no conviction about the latter but merely use the proper language, while the essence of mathematical objects is plain enough to them?"
"For () philosophic wisdom will contemplate none of the things that will make a man happy (for it is not concerned with any coming into being), and though practical wisdom has this merit, for what purpose do we need it?"
"Now this view plainly contradicts the observed facts, and we must inquire about what happens to such a man; if he acts by reason of ignorance, what is the manner of his ignorance?"
Is it then practical wisdom whose resistance is mastered?
"() Further, if incontinence and continence are concerned with any and every kind of object, who is it that is incontinent in the unqualified sense?"
"This is why we should describe as self-indulgent rather the man who without appetite or with but a slight appetite pursues the excesses of pleasure and avoids moderate pains, than the man who does so because of his strong appetites; for what would the former do, if he had in addition a vigorous appetite, and a violent pain at the lack of the 'necessary' objects?"
"Now any one would think worse of a man with no appetite or with weak appetite were he to do something disgraceful, than if he did it under the influence of powerful appetite, and worse of him if he struck a blow not in anger than if he did it in anger; for what would he have done if he had been strongly affected?"
Or is it incidentally any and every choice but per se the true rule and the right choice by which the one abides and the other does not?
"the activity of our faculties, is not a good, it will not be the case that the happy man lives a pleasant life; for to what end should he need pleasure, if it is not a good but the happy man may even live a painful life?"
"For pain is neither an evil nor a good, if pleasure is not; why then should he avoid it?"
Are the necessary pleasures good in the sense in which even that which is not bad is good?
Or are they good up to a point?
"Is it that where you have states and processes of which there cannot be too much, there cannot be too much of the corresponding pleasure, and that where there can be too much of the one there can be too much of the other also?"
"For without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods; even rich men and those in possession of office and of dominating power are thought to need friends most of all; for what is the use of such prosperity without the opportunity of beneficence, which is exercised chiefly and in its most laudable form towards friends?"
Or how can prosperity be guarded and preserved without friends?
"Do men love, then, the good, or what is good for them?"
Or must we add 'when it is recognized'?
These people seem to bear goodwill to each other; but how could one call them friends when they do not know their mutual feelings?
"But the man who is in a state of need and inferiority makes the opposite claim; they think it is the part of a good friend to help those who are in need; what, they say, is the use of being the friend of a good man or a powerful man, if one is to get nothing out of it?"
But who is to fix the worth of the service; he who makes the sacrifice or he who has got the advantage?
"All such questions are hard, are they not, to decide with precision?"
"should a man who has been ransomed out of the hands of brigands ransom his ransomer in return, whoever he may be (or pay him if he has not been captured but demands payment) or should he ransom his father?"
"But if one accepts another man as good, and he turns out badly and is seen to do so, must one still love him?"
"Must the friendship, then, be forthwith broken off?"
"Or is this not so in all cases, but only when one's friends are incurable in their wickedness?"
"But if one friend remained the same while the other became better and far outstripped him in virtue, should the latter treat the former as a friend?"
"in the case of childish friendships; if one friend remained a child in intellect while the other became a fully developed man, how could they be friends when they neither approved of the same things nor delighted in and were pained by the same things?"
"Should he, then, behave no otherwise towards him than he would if he had never been his friend?"
"Are we to say then that in so far as they are satisfied with themselves and think they are good, they share in these attributes?"
"What then is it that the first school means, and in what respect is it right?"
Is it that most identify friends with useful people?
"   Should we, then, make as many friends as possible, or-as in the case of hospitality it is thought to be suitable advice, that one should be 'neither a man of many guests nor a man with none'-will that apply to friendship as well; should a man neither be friendless nor have an excessive number of friends?"
"But as regards good friends, should we have as many as possible, or is there a limit to the number of one's friends, as there is to the size of a city?"
   Do we need friends more in good fortune or in bad?
"   Does it not follow, then, that, as for lovers the sight of the beloved is the thing they love most, and they prefer this sense to the others because on it love depends most for its being and for its origin, so for friends the most desirable thing is living together?"
"What, then, is there that satisfies this criterion, which at the same time we can participate in?"
"If it is senseless creatures that desire the things in question, there might be something in what they say; but if intelligent creatures do so as well, what sense can there be in this view?"
"Again, just as health admits of degrees without being indeterminate, why should not pleasure?"
"Again, how can it be a coming into being?"
Of what then will these be the coming into being?
"How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased?"
Is it that we grow weary?
"Those which are admittedly disgraceful plainly should not be said to be pleasures, except to a perverted taste; but of those that are thought to be good what kind of pleasure or what pleasure should be said to be that proper to man?"
Is it not plain from the corresponding activities?
"The liberal man will need money for the doing of his liberal deeds, and the just man too will need it for the returning of services (for wishes are hard to discern, and even people who are not just pretend to wish to act justly); and the brave man will need power if he is to accomplish any of the acts that correspond to his virtue, and the temperate man will need opportunity; for how else is either he or any of the others to be recognized?"
We assume the gods to be above all other beings blessed and happy; but what sort of actions must we assign to them?
Acts of justice?
"Will not the gods seem absurd if they make contracts and return deposits, and so on?"
"Acts of a brave man, then, confronting dangers and running risks because it is noble to do so?"
Or liberal acts?
To whom will they give?
And what would their temperate acts be?
"Is not such praise tasteless, since they have no bad appetites?"
"Now if you take away from a living being action, and still more production, what is left but contemplation?"
"   If these matters and the virtues, and also friendship and pleasure, have been dealt with sufficiently in outline, are we to suppose that our programme has reached its end?"
What argument would remould such people?
"For he who lives as passion directs will not hear argument that dissuades him, nor understand it if he does; and how can we persuade one in such a state to change his ways?"
"Must we not, then, next examine whence or how one can learn how to legislate?"
"Is it, as in all other cases, from statesmen?"
Or is a difference apparent between statesmanship and the other sciences and arts?
"Now laws are as it were the' works' of the political art; how then can one learn from them to be a legislator, or judge which are best?"
"And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
" And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
" And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?"
"Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
" And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?"
" And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth?"
and why is thy countenance fallen?
" If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?"
" And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?"
"And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
" And he said, What hast thou done?"
" And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me?"
why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
" Why saidst thou, She is my sister?"
 Is not the whole land before thee?
" And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
" And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
" And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou?"
and whither wilt thou go?
" And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
" Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?"
"and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
" And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife?"
" Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
" And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?"
 Is any thing too hard for the LORD?
" And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
" And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
" That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
" And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?"
" But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night?"
" And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides?"
" But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
" Said he not unto me, She is my sister?"
" Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us?"
"and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?"
" And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
" And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck?"
" And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?"
" And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
"And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
" And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,  My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee?"
" And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
" And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;  And said, Whose daughter art thou?"
"tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
" And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without?"
" And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou?"
" And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man?"
" For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?"
" And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus?"
" And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
" And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister?"
" And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us?"
" And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
" And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
" And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?"
" And he said, Art thou my very son Esau?"
" And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou?"
" And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who?"
"where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him?"
" And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob?"
"And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
" And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?"
" And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?"
" Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;  And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;  Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
" And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
" And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye?"
" And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?"
" And he said unto them, Is he well?"
" And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought?"
"tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
" And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me?"
did not I serve with thee for Rachel?
wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
" And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
" And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband?"
and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?
" For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?"
" And he said, What shall I give thee?"
" And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
 Are we not counted of him strangers?
" And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
" Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
" And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
" And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass?"
"what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
" Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff?"
" And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?"
" And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou?"
and whither goest thou?
and whose are these before thee?
" And he said unto him, What is thy name?"
"And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?"
" And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee?"
" And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?"
"And he said, What needeth it?"
 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's?
" And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
" And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?"
or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?
" And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?"
Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
" And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem?"
" And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
" And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
" And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
"And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
"And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?"
" And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?"
" Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side?"
" And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth?"
" But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;  There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
" And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?"
"And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God?"
" And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
" Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
" And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye?"
" And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?"
" And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
" And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
" And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive?"
have ye another brother?
"and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
" And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake?"
Is he yet alive?
" And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me?"
" And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
" Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth?"
" And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?"
"God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:  Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
" And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?"
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
" And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord?"
what shall we speak?
or how shall we clear ourselves?
" My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
" For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?"
" And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?"
" And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
" And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?"
" And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?"
" And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence?"
" When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:  Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?"
" And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
" Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?"
" And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
" And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?"
" Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
" And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?"
" And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?"
"intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?"
" And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?"
" And he said unto his daughters, And where is he?"
why is it that ye have left the man?
" And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
" And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name?"
what shall I say unto them?
" And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand?"
" And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth?"
"or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind?"
have not I the LORD?
" And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?"
" And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?"
" And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works?"
" And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?"
" Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?"
" And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people?"
why is it that thou hast sent me?
" And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?"
" And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?"
" And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?"
" And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?"
" As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?"
" And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me?"
" And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us?"
"let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?"
" And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?"
" And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?"
" And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this?"
" And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
" And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?"
"wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?"
" Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?"
" And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?"
" Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods?"
"who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
" And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?"
" And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:  And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?"
" And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we?"
" And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?"
"And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me?"
wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?
" And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"
" And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people?"
" And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?"
" And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people?"
"why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?"
" If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:  For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep?"
" And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?"
" Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth?"
" And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?"
" And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)  Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side?"
 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?
is it not in that thou goest with us?
" And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?"
" And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?"
" And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?"
" And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:  And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?"
" And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
" And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?"
"and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?"
 Have I conceived all this people?
"have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?"
 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people?
" And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
" Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;  But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?"
" Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?"
"or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?"
" And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short?"
" And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake?"
" And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses?"
hath he not spoken also by us?
" With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
" And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days?"
" And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey?"
were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
" And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me?"
"and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?"
" And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me?"
" And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD?"
" Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:  And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:  And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?"
" And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:  Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?"
" And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?"
" For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?"
" And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:  Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?"
" Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men?"
" And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?"
 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?
" And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?"
" And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?"
" And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"
" And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?"
" And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?"
" And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?"
" And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day?"
was I ever wont to do so unto thee?
" And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?"
" And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee?"
wherefore camest thou not unto me?
am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
" And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing?"
" How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?"
"or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?"
" Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?"
" And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me?"
" And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?"
"And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?"
" And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:  God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?"
"or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"
" But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?"
" He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up?"
" And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,  If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?"
" Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son?"
" And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?"
" And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?"
 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
" How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?"
 Whither shall we go up?
 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?
" And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,  O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?"
" For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?"
" And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"
" For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?"
" Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?"
" Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
 Now therefore why should we die?
" For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?"
" And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?"
" If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?"
" And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,  To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?"
" Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?"
" When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;  Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods?"
" And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?"
" And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it?"
" And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it?"
" And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her?"
" And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?"
" And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:  So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;  And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:  Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land?"
what meaneth the heat of this great anger?
" It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?"
" Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?"
" Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?"
" For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?"
" Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise?"
is not he thy father that hath bought thee?
"hath he not made thee, and established thee?"
" How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?"
" Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?"
" And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,  Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings?"
 Have not I commanded thee?
" Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:  And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:  That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?"
" And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?"
" And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?"
"And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?"
" And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us?"
" For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?"
" And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?"
" And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us?"
" And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?"
"And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye?"
and from whence come ye?
" And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?"
Is not this written in the book of Jasher?
" And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?"
" And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?"
" And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?"
" And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,  Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?"
" Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,  But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?"
" Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel?"
" Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,  The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)  That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;  And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?"
"The Book of Judges    Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?"
" And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?"
 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
" And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?"
" And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee?"
" Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here?"
 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
" Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks?"
 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
" The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming?"
why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
" Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,  Have they not sped?"
"have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?"
" And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us?"
"and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?"
" And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?"
" And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?"
" And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing?"
" And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal?"
will ye save him?
" And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?"
" And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?"
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
" God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?"
" And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?"
" And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?"
" Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor?"
" And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,  Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you?"
" But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
" But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
" And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
" And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?"
is not he the son of Jerubbaal?
and Zebul his officer?
serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
" Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?"
is not this the people that thou hast despised?
" And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?"
" And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon?"
" And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house?"
and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
" And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
" And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?"
" So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?"
 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess?
" And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab?"
"did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,  While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years?"
why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?
" And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee?"
" And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"
" And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite?"
" And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman?"
"How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?"
" And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?"
" And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?"
" Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?"
" And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have?"
is it not so?
"And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?"
" And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?"
And what is stronger than a lion?
" And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she?"
" Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this?"
" And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us?"
" Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us?"
what is this that thou hast done unto us?
" And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
" And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me?"
" And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou?"
" When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither?"
and what makest thou in this place?
and what hast thou here?
" And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?"
" And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still?"
" Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?"
"Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?"
" And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?"
"And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?"
" And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more?"
"and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?"
" And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou?"
and whence comest thou?
"Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?"
" And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?"
" And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?"
" (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?"
" And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,  And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?"
" And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;  And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?"
" And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?"
" How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"
" And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD?"
" Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
" And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?"
"are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
"If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  Would ye tarry for them till they were grown?"
would ye stay for them from having husbands?
"And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?"
" I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?"
" Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?"
" Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter?"
"Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:  Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee?"
" Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"
" And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?"
and where wroughtest thou?
" Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
" And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?"
" And he said, Who art thou?"
" And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter?"
" Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?"
and why eatest thou not?
and why is thy heart grieved?
am not I better to thee than ten sons?
" And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken?"
" And he said unto them, Why do ye such things?"
" If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?"
" And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?"
" And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me?"
and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
" Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?"
" And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?"
" And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?"
" And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?"
who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?
" And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult?"
"And he said, What is there done, my son?"
" They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?"
" And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD?"
" Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?"
" Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?"
"when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
" And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God?"
and to whom shall he go up from us?
" Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man?"
"for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"
" And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
And on whom is all the desire of Israel?
"Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?"
" And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel?"
and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
" Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?"
" When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
" And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?"
Is Saul also among the prophets?
" And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father?"
"Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
" And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?"
" And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?"
" But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?"
" And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep?"
" And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us?"
" Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken?"
or whose ass have I taken?
or whom have I defrauded?
whom have I oppressed?
or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?
 Is it not wheat harvest to day?
" And Samuel said, What hast thou done?"
" How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found?"
for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
" And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?"
wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
" And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?"
" And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
" And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?"
" Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?"
" And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?"
" And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?"
" And Samuel said, How can I go?"
"And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?"
" And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children?"
" And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array?"
"am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul?"
" And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?"
" And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel?"
"for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
" And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither?"
and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?
" And David said, What have I now done?"
Is there not a cause?
" And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?"
" And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?"
" And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man?"
" And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?"
" And David said unto Saul, Who am I?"
"and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?"
"And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
" And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:  For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"
" And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped?"
"And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?"
" Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?"
"Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
" And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done?"
what is mine iniquity?
"and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?"
" And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me?"
" Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"
" And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
" Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me?"
or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
" And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?"
" Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?"
" And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain?"
what hath he done?
" And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?"
" Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?"
 Now therefore what is under thine hand?
" And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword?"
" And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land?"
"did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
" Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?"
" Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence?"
shall this fellow come into my house?
" When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)  Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;  That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
" And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
" Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?"
 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him?
" Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?"
" And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?
"will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard?"
" Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?"
" Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?"
" And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?"
 After whom is the king of Israel come out?
after whom dost thou pursue?
" And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David?"
" For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?"
" And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?"
and who is the son of Jesse?
" Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?"
" And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?"
" Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?"
" And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?"
" Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:  And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner?"
"Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?"
" And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man?"
and who is like to thee in Israel?
wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?
" And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David?"
" And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?"
for what have I done?
or what evil is in mine hand?
" And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"
" And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day?"
" And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
" Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee?"
" And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me?"
" And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?"
" And he said unto her, What form is he of?"
" And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?"
" Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?"
" Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?"
"And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?"
" And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master?"
should it not be with the heads of these men?
" Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
" And David said unto Achish, But what have I done?"
"and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
" And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop?"
shall I overtake them?
" And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou?"
and whence art thou?
" And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?"
 For who will hearken unto you in this matter?
" And David said unto him, From whence comest thou?"
" And David said unto him, How went the matter?"
" And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?"
" And he said unto me, Who art thou?"
" And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?"
" And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
" And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?"
"And David said, Whither shall I go up?"
" Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel?"
" And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground?"
how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
" Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?"
knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
"how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?"
" And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?"
" Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?"
" And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land?"
" Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?"
"behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
" And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?"
" And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"
" And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:  How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed?"
"shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
" And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines?"
wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?
" And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?"
" And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?"
" In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?"
" Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD?"
"and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?"
"And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?"
 And what can David say more unto thee?
" And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?"
" And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
"And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?"
" And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him?"
" And the king said unto him, Where is he?"
" And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?"
" And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?"
"hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
"And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
" And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?"
why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?
" And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?"
" Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;  And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,  And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight?"
knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?
"did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez?"
why went ye nigh the wall?
" Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight?"
"And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
" But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead?"
" Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done?"
" And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?"
" But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?"
can I bring him back again?
" And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day?"
wilt thou not tell me?
" And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go?"
" And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee?"
"And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?"
" Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you?"
" And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?"
" And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?"
" And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?"
" Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?"
" And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?"
" And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou?"
" Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us?"
" Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us?"
" The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?"
 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?
" And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these?"
" And the king said, And where is thy master's son?"
" Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?"
" And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?"
"Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?"
" And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it?"
" And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?"
why wentest thou not with thy friend?
" And again, whom should I serve?"
should I not serve in the presence of his son?
" And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying?"
" And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?"
" And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?"
"And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?"
" And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe?"
" And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?"
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
" And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?"
" Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?"
" And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?"
" But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?"
" And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?"
shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel?
for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
" And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?"
What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
" And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?"
" And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?"
 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil?
can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?
wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
" And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?"
" And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter?"
have we eaten at all of the king's cost?
or hath he given us any gift?
" And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?"
" And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother?"
" And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?"
 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
" Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?"
"and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"
" For who is God, save the LORD?"
"and who is a rock, save our God?"
" And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?"
 Was he not most honourable of three?
" And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?"
" So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land?"
"or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee?"
or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land?
" And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done?"
" And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?"
" And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so?"
" Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?"
" Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
why then doth Adonijah reign?
"And the king said, What wouldest thou?"
" And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
" Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
"And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?"
"And she said, Comest thou peaceably?"
" And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?"
" And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?"
" Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?"
" Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?"
 But will God indeed dwell on the earth?
"behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?"
" But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:  Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:  And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?"
" And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?"
" Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?"
" And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?"
" And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?"
" But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:  And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?"
" So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?"
" And their father said unto them, What way went he?"
"So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,  And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?"
" And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another?"
" Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"

" Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God?"
"art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?"
" And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?"
" And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?"
" And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?"
" Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?"
" And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?"
" And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions?"
" And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?"
"And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?"
"And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?"
" And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?"
" And Ahab said, By whom?"
"Then he said, Who shall order the battle?"
"And he said, Is he yet alive?"
" But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?"
" And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel?"
" And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?"
" And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?"
" And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?"
" And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
" And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?"
" Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"
" And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?"
"And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear?"
" And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?"
" And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?"
" And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead?"
" And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?"
" But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?"
" And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?"
" And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?"
" And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
" And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?"
" And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?"
" He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;  And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah?"
" And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?"
" And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?"
" And he said, Which way shall we go up?"
" But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him?"
" And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?"
" And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee?"
"tell me, what hast thou in the house?"
" And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?"
"wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?"
" And he said, What then is to be done for her?"
" And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day?"
"And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:  Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee?"
is it well with thy husband?
is it well with the child?
" Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord?"
"did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
" And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?"
" And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?"
" And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?"
" Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?"
"may I not wash in them, and be clean?"
" And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?"
"how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?"
" And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?"
"And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?"
"And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi?"
" And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?"
"Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?"
" And the man of God said, Where fell it?"
" Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?"
how shall we do?
" And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them?"
shall I smite them?
" And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow?"
" And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?"
"out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?"
" And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?"
" But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?"
"look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
" And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
" Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?"
" And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?"
" And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:  And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?"
" And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
" So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
" And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?"
" And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?"
" So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee?"
" And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
"And Jehu said, Unto which of all us?"
" Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well?"
wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?
"And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?"
" So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?"
"And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace?"
" Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?"
"And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace?"
" And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu?"
"And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?"
" And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?"
" And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?"
who?
" But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?"
" And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?"
"And as he was at the shearing house in the way,  Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye?"
" And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?"
" And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
" And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"

" Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?"
"Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?"
" But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?"
" How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?
" But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words?"
"hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?"
 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
" Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad?"
"where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?"
have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
" Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?"
" Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?"
" Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?"
" Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?"
 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed?
"and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?"
" Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it?"
" And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?"
" And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?"
" Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men?"
and from whence came they unto thee?
" And he said, What have they seen in thine house?"
"And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?"
" And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"

" And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy?"
" And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"
" And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines?"
And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?
" Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?"
" And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?"
 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?
" And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?"
" But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?"
"are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
" And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants?"
why then doth my lord require this thing?
why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
" And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered?"
"even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done?"
" David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,  Is not the LORD your God with you?"
and hath he not given you rest on every side?
And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?
" But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?"
" Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?"
" But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him?"
"who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?"
 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?
" And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
" And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?"
" And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?"
" And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?"
" Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?"
" And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;  Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?"
" Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands?"
" Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen?"
" And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead?"
" Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"
" But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?"
" And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"
" And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?"
" And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?"
" And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead?"
"And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?"
" Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?"
" And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD?"
" And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,  And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven?"
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen?
"and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?"
" Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?"
" O our God, wilt thou not judge them?"
" And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?"
" And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper?"
" And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?"
" Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?"
" And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel?"
forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?
" Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?"
" Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
" And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?"
" So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"
" After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,  Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?"
" Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
" Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?"
 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands?
were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?
" Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?"
" Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?"
" But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?"
Who is there among you of all his people?
 Who is there among you of all his people?
 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
" At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?"
" Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?"
" Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?"
" Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
" And now, O our God, what shall we say after this?"
" And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;  Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations?"
"wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?"
" Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick?"
"Then I was very sore afraid,  And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
" Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?"
" And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be?"
and when wilt thou return?
" But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do?"
will ye rebel against the king?
" And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews?"
will they fortify themselves?
will they sacrifice?
will they make an end in a day?
will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
" And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren?"
or shall they be sold unto us?
" Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?"
" And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"
" And I said, Should such a man as I flee?"
"and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life?"
" Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken?"
" Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?"
" Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city?"
" Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall?"
 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things?
" Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?"
" Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:  And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)  What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?"
" Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?"
" For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
" Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther?"
and what is thy request?
" And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition?"
and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request?
" And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?"
" And the king said, Who is in the court?"
"And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour?"
"Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?"
" And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther?"
and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request?
" Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?"
"Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house?"
"So Esther arose, and stood before the king,  And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:  For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?"
or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
" And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces?"
now what is thy petition?
and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further?
" And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
" And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou?"
" And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?"
" Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?"
" Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?"
" And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou?"
" And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?"
" Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?"
What?
"shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"
 Why died I not from the womb?
why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
 Why did the knees prevent me?
or why the breasts that I should suck?
" Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;  Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;  Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
" Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
" Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,  If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?"
but who can withhold himself from speaking?
" Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?"
" Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?"
or where were the righteous cut off?
" Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:  It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,  Shall mortal man be more just than God?"
shall a man be more pure than his maker?
" Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:  How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?"
 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?
" Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?"
 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
or loweth the ox over his fodder?
 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?
or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
" What is my strength, that I should hope?"
"and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?"
 Is my strength the strength of stones?
or is my flesh of brass?
 Is not my help in me?
and is wisdom driven quite from me?
" Did I say, Bring unto me?"
"or, Give a reward for me of your substance?"
" Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand?"
"or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
but what doth your arguing reprove?
" Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?"
 Is there iniquity in my tongue?
cannot my taste discern perverse things?
 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth?
are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
" When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?"
" Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?"
" What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?"
and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
" And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?"
" How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
" I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?"
"why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?"
" And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity?"
" Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,  How long wilt thou speak these things?"
and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
 Doth God pervert judgment?
or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
" For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:  (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)  Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?"
 Can the rush grow up without mire?
can the flag grow without water?
" Then Job answered and said,  I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?"
" He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?"
" Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?"
"who will say unto him, What doest thou?"
" How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?"
" If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?"
" The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?"
" If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?"
" Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
 Hast thou eyes of flesh?
or seest thou as man seeth?
 Are thy days as the days of man?
"are thy years as man's days,  That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?"
" Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
" Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?
 Are not my days few?
" Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,  Should not the multitude of words be answered?"
and should a man full of talk be justified?
 Should thy lies make men hold their peace?
"and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?"
 Canst thou by searching find out God?
canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?
deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
" If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?"
 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
" But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?"
 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
 Doth not the ear try words?
and the mouth taste his meat?
 Will ye speak wickedly for God?
and talk deceitfully for him?
 Will ye accept his person?
will ye contend for God?
 Is it good that he should search you out?
"or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?"
 Shall not his excellency make you afraid?
and his dread fall upon you?
" Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?"
 Who is he that will plead with me?
 How many are mine iniquities and sins?
" Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?"
 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?
and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
" And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
" But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?"
" If a man die, shall he live again?"
 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
" Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,  Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
 Should he reason with unprofitable talk?
or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
 Art thou the first man that was born?
or wast thou made before the hills?
 Hast thou heard the secret of God?
and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
" What knowest thou, that we know not?"
"what understandest thou, which is not in us?"
 Are the consolations of God small with thee?
is there any secret thing with thee?
 Why doth thine heart carry thee away?
"and what do thy eyes wink at,  That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?"
" What is man, that he should be clean?"
"and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
" How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?"
" He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?"
 Shall vain words have an end?
or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
" Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?"
 Are there not mockers with me?
and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
" Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?"
 And where is now my hope?
"as for my hope, who shall see it?"
" Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,  How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?"
" Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?"
 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
" Then Job answered and said,  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
" Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
" But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?"
" Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,  That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?"
" Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;  Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?"
" As for me, is my complaint to man?"
"and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?"
" Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?"
" What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?"
"and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
" For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
 Shall any teach God knowledge?
" For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?"
and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
 Have ye not asked them that go by the way?
"and do ye not know their tokens,  That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?"
 Who shall declare his way to his face?
and who shall repay him what he hath done?
" How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?"
" Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,  Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?"
" Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?"
"or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?
will he enter with thee into judgment?
 Is not thy wickedness great?
and thine iniquities infinite?
 Is not God in the height of heaven?
" And thou sayest, How doth God know?"
can he judge through the dark cloud?
 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
" Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:  Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?"
 Will he plead against me with his great power?
" But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?"
" Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?"
" And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"
 Is there any number of his armies?
and upon whom doth not his light arise?
 How then can man be justified with God?
or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
" How much less man, that is a worm?"
"and the son of man, which is a worm?"
" But Job answered and said,  How hast thou helped him that is without power?"
how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom?
and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
 To whom hast thou uttered words?
and whose spirit came from thee?
" Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?"
but the thunder of his power who can understand?
" For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?"
 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
 Will he delight himself in the Almighty?
will he always call upon God?
" Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?"
 But where shall wisdom be found?
and where is the place of understanding?
 Whence then cometh wisdom?
and where is the place of understanding?
" Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?"
 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
was not my soul grieved for the poor?
 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
 For what portion of God is there from above?
and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
 Is not destruction to the wicked?
and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
" Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
" If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;  What then shall I do when God riseth up?"
"and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
 Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
and did not one fashion us in the womb?
" If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:  Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?"
 Why dost thou strive against him?
 Should I lie against my right?
" What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?"
 Who hath given him a charge over the earth?
or who hath disposed the whole world?
 Shall even he that hateth right govern?
and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
" Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked?"
"and to princes, Ye are ungodly?"
" How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?"
" When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?"
"and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?"
 Should it be according to thy mind?
" Elihu spake moreover, and said,  Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?"
" For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?"
"and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?"
" If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him?"
"or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?"
" If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?"
or what receiveth he of thine hand?
" But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
 Will he esteem thy riches?
" Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?"
 Who hath enjoined him his way?
"or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?"
" Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?"
" Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
" Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?"
" How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?"
" Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?"
 Shall it be told him that I speak?
" Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,  Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?"
 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
" Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?"
or who hath stretched the line upon it?
 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
"or who laid the corner stone thereof;  When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
" Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?"
" When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,  And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?"
" Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;  That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?
or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
 Where is the way where light dwelleth?
"and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,  That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?"
" Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?"
or because the number of thy days is great?
 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?
"or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,  Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?"
" By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?"
" Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;  To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;  To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?"
 Hath the rain a father?
or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
 Out of whose womb came the ice?
"and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?"
" Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?"
 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?
or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?
canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
" Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?"
" Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?"
 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
or who hath given understanding to the heart?
 Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
"or who can stay the bottles of heaven,  When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?"
 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?
"or fill the appetite of the young lions,  When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?"
 Who provideth for the raven his food?
 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?
or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
 Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
" Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?"
 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?
or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
" Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?"
or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
" Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?"
 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?
or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
 Hast thou given the horse strength?
hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?
" Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?"
" Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?"
" Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?"
" Then Job answered the LORD, and said,  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?"
 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?
"wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?"
 Hast thou an arm like God?
or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
 Canst thou put an hook into his nose?
or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
 Will he make many supplications unto thee?
will he speak soft words unto thee?
 Will he make a covenant with thee?
wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
 Shall the companions make a banquet of him?
shall they part him among the merchants?
 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
or his head with fish spears?
" Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
" Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?"
 Who can discover the face of his garment?
or who can come to him with his double bridle?
 Who can open the doors of his face?
 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?
" Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?"
" O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?"
"how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?"
" There be many that say, Who will shew us any good?"
" My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?"
 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
" When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;   What is man, that thou art mindful of him?"
"and the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
" Why standest thou afar off, O LORD?"
why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?
" In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?"
" If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?"
" The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:   Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?"
" How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD?"
for ever?
how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
" How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?"
how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
" Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?"
who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
 For who is God save the LORD?
or who is a rock save our God?
 Who can understand his errors?
" My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
"why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?"
 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD?
or who shall stand in his holy place?
 Who is this King of glory?
 Who is this King of glory?
 What man is he that feareth the LORD?
 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
" What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?"
Shall the dust praise thee?
shall it declare thy truth?
" What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?"
" All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?"
" Lord, how long wilt thou look on?"
" And now, Lord, what wait I for?"
" Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?"
" My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?"
" My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?"
" Why art thou cast down, O my soul?"
and why art thou disquieted in me?
" I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?"
why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
" As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?"
" Why art thou cast down, O my soul?"
and why art thou disquieted within me?
 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?
why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
" Why art thou cast down, O my soul?"
and why art thou disquieted within me?
" If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;   Shall not God search this out?"
" Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?"
" Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?"
" Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?"
" Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?"
" But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?"
" Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man?"
 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
 Shall they escape by iniquity?
 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
" For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?"
" Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation?"
"do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?"
" Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?"
 Who will bring me into the strong city?
who will lead me into Edom?
" Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off?"
"and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?"
 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?
" They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?"
" Why leap ye, ye high hills?"
" And they say, How doth God know?"
and is there knowledge in the most High?
 Whom have I in heaven but thee?
" O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever?"
why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
" O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?"
shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
" Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand?"
" Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?"
 Will the Lord cast off for ever?
and will he be favourable no more?
 Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
doth his promise fail for evermore?
 Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
" Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?"
" Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?"
" Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also?"
can he provide flesh for his people?
" How long, LORD?"
wilt thou be angry for ever?
shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
" Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God?"
" O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?"
" Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?"
" How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?"
 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?
wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?
shall the dead arise and praise thee?
 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?
or thy faithfulness in destruction?
 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
" LORD, why castest thou off my soul?"
why hidest thou thy face from me?
 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD?
who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
" O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee?"
or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
" How long, LORD?"
wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
shall thy wrath burn like fire?
 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
" What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?"
shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
" Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?"
 Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
" Return, O LORD, how long?"
" LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?"
 How long shall they utter and speak hard things?
and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
" Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?"
" He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?"
"he that formed the eye, shall he not see?"
" He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?"
"he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?"
 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?
or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
" Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?"
O when wilt thou come unto me?
 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?
who can shew forth all his praise?
 Who will bring me into the strong city?
who will lead me into Edom?
" Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off?"
"and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?"
" What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest?"
"thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?"
" Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?"
" Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?"
 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?
" Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?"
 How many are the days of thy servant?
when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
 What shall be given unto thee?
"or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?"
" If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"
 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?
 Whither shall I go from thy spirit?
or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
" Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee?"
and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
" Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?"
"and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?"
" And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?"
" How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?"
when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
" Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?"
" Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?"
 Doth not wisdom cry?
and understanding put forth her voice?
 Do they not err that devise evil?
 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?
" Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?"
 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him?
 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
" Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?"
 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?
" The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?"
" Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,  That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?"
" If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?"
 Seest thou a man diligent in his business?
 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?
 Who hath woe?
who hath sorrow?
who hath contentions?
who hath babbling?
who hath wounds without cause?
who hath redness of eyes?
" They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake?"
" If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;  If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it?"
"and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?"
and shall not he render to every man according to his works?
" My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:  For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?"
 Hast thou found honey?
 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
" As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,  So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?"
" Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?"
 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?
 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?
" Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?"
who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
who hath bound the waters in a garment?
who hath established all the ends of the earth?
"what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?"
" Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:  Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:  Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD?"
" What, my son?"
"and what, the son of my womb?"
"and what, the son of my vows?"
 Who can find a virtuous woman?
 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
" Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?"
" I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?"
" And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king?"
" Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise?"
And how dieth the wise man?
 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool?
" For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?"
" For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?"
 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
" Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"
" Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?"
" There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?"
" Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?"
" Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?"
" When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?"
" And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?"
" Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?"
 For what hath the wise more than the fool?
"what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?"
" Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?"
" For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow?"
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
" Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these?"
" Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?"
 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
" Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?"
" That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"
 Who is as the wise man?
and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?
" Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?"
 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
" A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?"
" Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?"
" The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"
" Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?"
 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?
I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
" What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women?"
"what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?"
" Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?"
whither is thy beloved turned aside?
" Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"
What will ye see in the Shulamite?
" Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?"
" We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?"
 Why should ye be stricken any more?
 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
" When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?"
" Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?"
" What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor?"
" What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?"
"wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?"
" Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"
" Then said I, Lord, how long?"
" And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?"
" And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God?"
for the living to the dead?
" And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far?"
to whom will ye flee for help?
and where will ye leave your glory?
" For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?"
 Is not Calno as Carchemish?
is not Hamath as Arpad?
is not Samaria as Damascus?
" As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;  Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?"
 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
" All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we?"
art thou become like unto us?
" They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;  That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?"
" For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?"
"and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?"
 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation?
" Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?"
 Where are they?
where are thy wise men?
" And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?"
"He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night?"
"Watchman, what of the night?"
"What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?"
" Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,  What hast thou here?"
"and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?"
" Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?"
" Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?"
 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle?
" Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him?"
or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
 Whom shall he teach knowledge?
and whom shall he make to understand doctrine?
 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow?
doth he open and break the clods of his ground?
" When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?"
" Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us?"
and who knoweth us?
" Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not?"
"or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?"
" Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?"
Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
Where is the scribe?
where is the receiver?
where is he that counted the towers?
" And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?"
" I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?"
" But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?"
" How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it?
" But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words?"
"hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?"
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad?
where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
" Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?"
" Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?"
" Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?"
" Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?"
 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed?
"and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?"
" Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it?"
 What shall I say?
" Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"
" Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men?"
and from whence came they unto thee?
" Then said he, What have they seen in thine house?"
"And he said, What shall I cry?"
" Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?"
" Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?"
" With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?"
 To whom then will ye liken God?
or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
 Have ye not known?
have ye not heard?
hath it not been told you from the beginning?
have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
" To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal?"
" Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?"
 Hast thou not known?
"hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?"
" Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings?"
" Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning?"
" Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know?"
"and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous?"
" Who is blind, but my servant?"
"or deaf, as my messenger that I sent?"
"who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?"
 Who among you will give ear to this?
who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
" Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers?"
"did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned?"
" Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things?"
" Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?"
" Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it?"
" And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people?"
" Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it?"
Is there a God beside me?
" Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?"
" And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?"
shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
" He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?"
"Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou?"
"or thy work, He hath no hands?"
" Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?"
"or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?"
" Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time?"
who hath told it from that time?
have not I the LORD?
" To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?"
" Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it?"
" For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted?"
" All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things?"
" Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?"
" Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro?"
and who hath brought up these?
"Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?"
" Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?"
" Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away?"
or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?
" Wherefore, when I came, was there no man?"
"when I called, was there none to answer?"
"Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?"
or have I no power to deliver?
 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?
let us stand together: who is mine adversary?
" Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?"
" Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?"
"Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?"
" Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?"
" I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;  And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy?"
and where is the fury of the oppressor?
 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee?
"desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?"
" Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought?"
 Who hath believed our report?
and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation?
 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread?
and your labour for that which satisfieth not?
 Against whom do ye sport yourselves?
"against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue?"
" Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?"
Should I receive comfort in these?
" And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart?"
"have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?"
" Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?"
"wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?"
 Is it such a fast that I have chosen?
a day for a man to afflict his soul?
"is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?"
"wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?"
 Is not this the fast that I have chosen?
"to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?"
" Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?"
"when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?"
" Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?"
" Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?"
"this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?"
" Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?"
" Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock?"
where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?
" That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?"
" That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?"
" Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me?"
are they restrained?
" O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear?"
" Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD?"
"wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?"
" Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me?"
and where is the place of my rest?
 Who hath heard such a thing?
who hath seen such things?
Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?
or shall a nation be born at once?
" Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?"
"saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb?"
" Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou?"
" And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou?"
" Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:  Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?"
" Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?"
" The priests said not, Where is the LORD?"
" Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods?"
 Is Israel a servant?
is he a homeborn slave?
why is he spoiled?
" Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?"
" And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor?"
"or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?"
" Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?"
" How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim?"
"see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;  A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away?"
 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee?
 Wherefore will ye plead with me?
Have I been a wilderness unto Israel?
a land of darkness?
"wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?"
" Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire?"
 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love?
 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way?
" They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again?"
shall not that land be greatly polluted?
" Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?"
 Will he reserve his anger for ever?
will he keep it to the end?
" The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done?"
" But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations?"
How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
" How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?"
" And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do?"
" O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth?"
 How shall I pardon thee for this?
 Shall I not visit for these things?
saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
" And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us?"
" Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,  Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:  Fear ye not me?"
"saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?"
 Shall I not visit for these things?
saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
" A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;  The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?"
" To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?"
 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?
" To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country?"
" Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;  And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?"
" Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?"
 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
 Do they provoke me to anger?
saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
" Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise?"
"shall he turn away, and not return?"
 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?
" I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?"
" How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?"
" The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?"
 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?
 Why do we sit still?
 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion?
is not her king in her?
"Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?"
 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there?
why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
" Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?"
 Shall I not visit them for these things?
saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
" Who is the wise man, that may understand this?"
"and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?"
" Who would not fear thee, O King of nations?"
" What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee?"
" Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?"
wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
" How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein?"
" If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses?"
"and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?"
" Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?"
" Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?"
 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?
"for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?"
" And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me?"
" Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?"
wilt thou not be made clean?
when shall it once be?
" O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?"
" Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save?"
 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah?
hath thy soul lothed Zion?
"why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us?"
 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain?
or can the heavens give showers?
"art not thou he, O LORD our God?"
" And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth?"
" For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem?"
or who shall bemoan thee?
or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?
 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
" Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed?"
"wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?"
" And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us?"
or what is our iniquity?
or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?
" Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?"
" The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"
" Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD?"
" Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter?"
 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field?
or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
 Shall evil be recompensed for good?
" Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?"
" Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us?"
or who shall enter into our habitations?
" And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?"
" Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar?"
"did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?"
 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me?
 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol?
is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure?
"wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?"
" For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word?"
"who hath marked his word, and heard it?"
" Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?"
 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?
Do not I fill heaven and earth?
 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies?
What is the chaff to the wheat?
 Is not my word like as a fire?
saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
" And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD?"
"thou shalt then say unto them, What burden?"
" Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered?"
"and, What hath the LORD spoken?"
" Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee?"
"and, What hath the LORD spoken?"
" Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah?"
" For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?"
" Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?"
 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?
"did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them?"
" Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?"
" Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?"
" Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?"
" Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?"
"wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?"
 Why criest thou for thine affliction?
" And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me?"
 Is Ephraim my dear son?
is he a pleasant child?
" How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter?"
" Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?"
" Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,  Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off?"
" Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words?"
" And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?"
" And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?"
" When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD?"
" Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?"
" Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?"
" Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death?"
"and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?"
" Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,  And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee?"
" Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?"
" Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;  In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
" Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
" And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?"
" Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,  The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?"
 And seekest thou great things for thyself?
 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back?
" Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?"
 Why are thy valiant men swept away?
 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
" O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet?"
" How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore?"
" How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?"
" O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?"
 For was not Israel a derision unto thee?
was he found among thieves?
" Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons?"
hath he no heir?
"why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?"
" Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter?"
"that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?"
" Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman?"
is counsel perished from the prudent?
is their wisdom vanished?
" If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?"
" For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished?"
" Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?"
for who is like me?
and who will appoint me the time?
and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
" Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?"
for who is like me?
and who will appoint me the time?
and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
" Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?"
" They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine?"
 What thing shall I take to witness for thee?
"what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?"
"what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?"
for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
" All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?"
"Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?"
shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
" Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?"
 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
" Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?"
" Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?"
" He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?"
"even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?"
" Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery?"
" Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man?"
" Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man?"
Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here?
wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?
wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
" And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,  Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?"
" And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?"
" Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?"
" Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?"
"Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?"
" And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?"
" And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?"
" For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?"
" And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?"
 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work?
or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Is it meet for any work?
" Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?"
"Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,  That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?"
" Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper?"
"shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither?"
" Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper?"
"shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it?"
" Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?"
Shall he prosper?
shall he escape that doeth such things?
"or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?"
" The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?"
" If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,  And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,  Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,  Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live?"
" Yet say ye, Why?"
doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?
 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?
"saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?"
" But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?"
"Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal?"
are not your ways unequal?
"O house of Israel, are not my ways equal?"
are not your ways unequal?
" Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
" Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,  And say, What is thy mother?"
" Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,  Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me?"
" Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them?"
" Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?"
" Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers?"
and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?
" For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel?"
"they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?"
" And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?"
" Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:  It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth?"
" Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod?"
 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath?
" Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?"
" Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee?"
" The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah?"
" Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?"
" And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?"
" Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,  That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?"
" Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?"
" And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?"
" Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God?"
" And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?"
 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden?
 Whom dost thou pass in beauty?
" Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?"
" Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
" Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?"
" Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?"
should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
" Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures?"
"and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?"
" And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live?"
" And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?"
" Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil?"
hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey?
"to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?"
" Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?"
" Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?"
" And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this?"
" And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort?"
" Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:  He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king?"
" The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?"
" Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?"
" Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
" Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?"
" The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?"
" And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:  And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?"
"And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?"
" Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?"
" And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?"
" Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?"
 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
" Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee?"
" And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?"
" And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?"
" O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee?"
"O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?"
" Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?"
" What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?"
" Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give?"
" For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?"
" How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?"
"how shall I deliver thee, Israel?"
how shall I make thee as Admah?
how shall I set thee as Zeboim?
 Is there iniquity in Gilead?
 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities?
"and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?"
" Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?"
" Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?"
"prudent, and he shall know them?"
"Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?"
" Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?"
" The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:  And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?"
" Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?"
" Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?"
" Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine?"
will ye render me a recompence?
"Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel?"
" Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"
" Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey?"
"will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?"
" Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him?"
"shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?"
" Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?"
"shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?"
" The lion hath roared, who will not fear?"
"the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?"
to what end is it for you?
" Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light?"
"even very dark, and no brightness in it?"
" Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?"
" Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms?"
or their border greater than your border?
" And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee?"
 Shall horses run upon the rock?
will one plow there with oxen?
"for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:  Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?"
" And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise?"
" Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise?"
" And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou?"
" And he said, Amos, what seest thou?"
" Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,  Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?"
"and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?"
" That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?"
" Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein?"
" Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel?"
Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt?
"and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?"
" The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?"
would they not have stolen till they had enough?
"if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?"
" Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?"
" So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper?"
" Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation?"
and whence comest thou?
what is thy country?
and of what people art thou?
Why hast thou done this?
" Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?"
" Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?"
" And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?"
" Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?"
" And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?"
" Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:  And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?"
What is the transgression of Jacob?
is it not Samaria?
and what are the high places of Judah?
are they not Jerusalem?
" O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened?"
are these his doings?
do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
" And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?"
" The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us?"
 Now why dost thou cry out aloud?
is there no king in thee?
is thy counsellor perished?
" O my people, what have I done unto thee?"
and wherein have I wearied thee?
" Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God?"
"shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?"
" Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?"
"shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
" He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
" Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?"
" Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?"
" Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God?"
" Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?"
 Who can stand before his indignation?
and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger?
 What do ye imagine against the LORD?
" Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?"
" And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?"
whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
" Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?"
 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
" Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance?"
" Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?"
" Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?"
" And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?"
" Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?"
how long?
" Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?"
" Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?"
" What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?"
 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers?
was thine anger against the rivers?
"was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?"
" Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,  Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?"
Why?
" In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,  Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,  Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?"
and how do ye see it now?
is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
" In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,  If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?"
" Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?"
 Is the seed yet in the barn?
" Your fathers, where are they?"
"and the prophets, do they live for ever?"
" But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers?"
" Then said I, O my lord, what are these?"
" Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?"
" And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these?"
" Then said I, What come these to do?"
" Then said I, Whither goest thou?"
" And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"
" And said unto me, What seest thou?"
" So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?"
" Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be?"
" Who art thou, O great mountain?"
 For who hath despised the day of small things?
" Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?"
" And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?"
" And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?"
" And he said unto me, What seest thou?"
" And I said, What is it?"
" Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?"
" Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?"
" And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;  When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,  And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?"
" Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,  Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?"
" And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?"
" Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?"
" Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes?"
" And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?"
"Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?"
Was not Esau Jacob's brother?
" A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour?"
"and if I be a master, where is my fear?"
"And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?"
" Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee?"
" And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?"
"and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?"
"offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?"
" And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?"
 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?
"and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand?"
 Have we not all one father?
hath not one God created us?
"why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?"
" Yet ye say, Wherefore?"
 And did not he make one?
And wherefore one?
"Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him?"
"When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?"
 But who may abide the day of his coming?
and who shall stand when he appeareth?
"But ye said, Wherein shall we return?"
 Will a man rob God?
"But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?"
"Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?"
" Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?"
" Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,  Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews?"
" But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
" But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?"
" Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?"
" For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?"
do not even the publicans the same?
" And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?"
do not even the publicans so?
"Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?"
Are ye not much better than they?
 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
 And why take ye thought for raiment?
" Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?"
" Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?"
"or, What shall we drink?"
"or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?"
" And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
" Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?"
" Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?"
" Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?"
" If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
"Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"
" Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?"
and in thy name have cast out devils?
and in thy name done many wonderful works?
" And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?"
" And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God?"
art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
" And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"
" For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?"
" And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?"
" Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?"
" And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?"
" And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this?"
"If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?"
 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
" Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,  And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
" And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?"
A reed shaken with the wind?
 But what went ye out for to see?
A man clothed in soft raiment?
 But what went ye out for to see?
A prophet?
 But whereunto shall I liken this generation?
" But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;  How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?"
" Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?"
"And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?"
" And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?"
 How much then is a man better than a sheep?
" And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?"
" And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:  And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?"
" And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?"
" Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?"
" O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?"
" But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?"
and who are my brethren?
" And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?"
" So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?"
from whence then hath it tares?
"The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?"
" Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?"
" And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?"
 Is not this the carpenter's son?
is not his mother called Mary?
"and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?"
" And his sisters, are they not all with us?"
Whence then hath this man all these things?
" And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
" Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?"
" But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"
" Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?"
" And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?"
" Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?"
" And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?"
" And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?"
"O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
" Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?"
" Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
" Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
" How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?"
" When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"
" He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?"
" For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
" And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?"
" Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?"
how long shall I suffer you?
" Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?"
" And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?"
"And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?"
of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?
"of their own children, or of strangers?"
" At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
 How think ye?
"if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?"
" Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?"
till seven times?
" Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?"
" The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?"
" And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?"
" They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?"
" And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
" And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good?"
" He saith unto him, Which?"
" The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?"
" When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?"
" Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?"
" And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
" But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?"
 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
"Is thine eye evil, because I am good?"
" And he said unto her, What wilt thou?"
"Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
" And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?"
" And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?"
" And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,  And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say?"
"And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
" And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things?"
and who gave thee this authority?
" The baptism of John, whence was it?"
"from heaven, or of men?"
"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?"
 But what think ye?

" But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?"
" When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?"
" Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?"
" And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?"
" And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,  Art thou the Christ?"
" Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God?"
" And they said, What need we any further witness?"
" And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?"
" And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done?"
" For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
" But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?"
" And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?"
" And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?"
" And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?"
" And he said unto them, What things?"
" Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:  Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"
" And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
" And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?"
and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
" And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?"
" And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?"
" And they asked him, What then?"
Art thou Elias?
Art thou that prophet?
" Then said they unto him, Who art thou?"
What sayest thou of thyself?
" And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?"
" Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye?"
"They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?"
" And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
" Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?"
" Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?"
" Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?"
" Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
" Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?"
" Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?"
"can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
" Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?"
" Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
" If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"
" Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?"
" The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?"
" Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?"
" And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou?"
"or, Why talkest thou with her?"
" The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"
" Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?"
" Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?"
" When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?"
" Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?"
" How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?"
" But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
" When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"
" One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"
" And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?"
" Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?"
" They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee?"
what dost thou work?
" And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?"
"how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?"
" The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
" Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"
" When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?"
 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
" Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?"
" Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?"
" Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
" Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
" And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"
" Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?"
Why go ye about to kill me?
" The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?"
" If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"
" Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"
Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
" And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?"
" Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him?"
"will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?"
" What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?"
"But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?"
" Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?"
" Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?"
" Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?"
 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
" Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)  Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?"
" They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?"
" Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?"
" When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers?"
hath no man condemned thee?
" Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?"
" Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?"
" Then said they unto him, Who art thou?"
" They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?"
 Why do ye not understand my speech?
 Which of you convinceth me of sin?
"And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?"
" Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?"
" Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead?"
and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
" Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"
" And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
" The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"
" Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?"
" Then said they unto him, Where is he?"
"Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?"
" They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?"
" And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind?"
how then doth he now see?
" Then said they to him again, What did he to thee?"
how opened he thine eyes?
" He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again?"
will ye also be his disciples?
" They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?"
" Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
" He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?"
" And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?"
" And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?"
Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
" Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt?"
" Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?"
" Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"
" If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;  Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?"
" His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?"
" Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?"
Believest thou this?
" And said, Where have ye laid him?"
" And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
" Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"
" Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we?"
" Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"
" Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
" The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing?"
 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
" The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?"
who is this Son of man?
" But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
" Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"
" So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?"
" He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?"
" Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou?"
" Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now?"
" Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?"
" Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?"
" Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?"
"he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?"
" Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?"
" Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?"
" But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?"
" Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?"
" They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while?"
" Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?"
" Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?"
" Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?"
" Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye?"
" Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
" Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples?"
 Why askest thou me?
" And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?"
" Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?"
"They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples?"
" One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?"
" Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?"
" Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"
" Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?"
" Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?"
Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
" Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then?"
" Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?"
" But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
" When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;  And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou?"
" Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me?"
"knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?"
"Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King?"
" And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?"
" Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?"
whom seekest thou?
" Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat?"
"And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou?"
" So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?"
" He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?"
" He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?"
"Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me?"
" Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?"
" Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?"
" Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"
" Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"
" When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
" And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;  Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?"
" And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?"
" And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?"
" And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?"
" Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
" And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?"
"or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"
" And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"
" But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  Saying, What shall we do to these men?"
" And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:  Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"
" But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"
" Whiles it remained, was it not thine own?"
"and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?"
why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
" And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much?"
" Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?"
" And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,  Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name?"
" Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
" And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?"
" But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?"
" Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?"
" This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge?"
" Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?"
" Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me?"
saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?
 Hath not my hand made all these things?
 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?
" And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?"
" And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?"
" The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation?"
" And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this?"
"of himself, or of some other man?"
" And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?"
" And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:  And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
" And he said, Who art thou, Lord?"
" And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
" But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?"
" And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?"
" Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?"
" Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?"
"Then answered Peter,  Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
" Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?"
" And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"
" And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?"
" Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,  And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things?"
" Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
" Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,  And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
" But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily?"
"And some said, What will this babbler say?"
" And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?"
" And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,  He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?"
" And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized?"
" And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
" And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"
" Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?"
 What is it therefore?
" And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee?"
"Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?"
" Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
" And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
" And I answered, Who art thou, Lord?"
" And I said, What shall I do, LORD?"
 And now why tarriest thou?
" And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
" Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman?"
" Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
" And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?"
" Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?"
" But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
" Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar?"
" Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
" And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
" And I said, Who art thou, Lord?"
" King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?"
" And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
" Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?"
"thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
" Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?"
"thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?"
" Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"
" Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
" And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?"
 What advantage then hath the Jew?
or what profit is there of circumcision?
 For what if some did not believe?
shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
" But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?"
Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?
(I speak as a man)  God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
" And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?"
 What then?
are we better than they?
 Where is boasting then?
By what law?
of works?
 Is he the God of the Jews only?
is he not also of the Gentiles?
 Do we then make void the law through faith?
" What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?"
 For what saith the scripture?
" Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also?"
 How was it then reckoned?
"when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?"
 What shall we say then?
"Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
"How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
" Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
 What then?
"shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?"
" Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
" Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?"
 What shall we say then?
Is the law sin?
 Was then that which is good made death unto me?
who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
" For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
 What shall we then say to these things?
"If God be for us, who can be against us?"
" He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?
 Who is he that condemneth?
 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
"shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
 What shall we say then?
Is there unrighteousness with God?
" Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault?"
For who hath resisted his will?
" Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?"
"Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?"
" Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"
" What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:  And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,  Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
 What shall we say then?
 Wherefore?
" But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?"
"(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)  Or, Who shall descend into the deep?"
 But what saith it?
 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
and how shall they hear without a preacher?
" And how shall they preach, except they be sent?"
"For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
" But I say, Have they not heard?"
" But I say, Did not Israel know?"
" I say then, Hath God cast away his people?"
Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias?
 But what saith the answer of God unto him?
 What then?
" I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?"
" Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?"
" For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?"
" For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?"
 For who hath known the mind of the Lord?
or who hath been his counsellor?
" Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?
 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?
 But why dost thou judge thy brother?
or why dost thou set at nought thy brother?
 Hast thou faith?
 Is Christ divided?
was Paul crucified for you?
or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
 Where is the wise?
where is the scribe?
where is the disputer of this world?
hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
" For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?"
" For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?"
" For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
" For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
" Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?"
" Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
 For who maketh thee to differ from another?
and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?
"now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
 What will ye?
"shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"
Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?
do not ye judge them that are within?
" Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?
"and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
 Know ye not that we shall judge angels?
how much more things that pertain to this life?
"Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?"
"no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
Why do ye not rather take wrong?
why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?
"shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?"
 What?
know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?
 What?
"know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
" For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?"
"or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"
 Is any man called being circumcised?
Is any called in uncircumcision?
 Art thou called being a servant?
 Art thou bound unto a wife?
Art thou loosed from a wife?
" For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;  And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
 Am I not an apostle?
am I not free?
have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?
are not ye my work in the Lord?
" Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,  Have we not power to eat and to drink?"
" Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
" Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?
"who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?"
"or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
 Say I these things as a man?
or saith not the law the same also?
Doth God take care for oxen?
 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes?
" If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
" If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?"
 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple?
and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
 What is my reward then?
" Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?"
" The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?"
"The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
 What say I then?
"that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
are we stronger than he?
" But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:  Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?"
" For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
" Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
 What?
have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?
"or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?"
What shall I say to you?
shall I praise you in this?
" If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
" And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
" If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?"
"If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"
" And if they were all one member, where were the body?"
 Are all apostles?
are all prophets?
are all teachers?
are all workers of miracles?
 Have all the gifts of healing?
do all speak with tongues?
do all interpret?
" Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
" And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
" For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
" So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken?"
 What is it then?
" Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
" If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
" How is it then, brethren?"
 What?
came the word of God out from you?
or came it unto you only?
" Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
" Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?"
why are they then baptized for the dead?
 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
" If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?"
" But some man will say, How are the dead raised up?"
and with what body do they come?
" O death, where is thy sting?"
"O grave, where is thy victory?"
" When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness?"
"or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
" For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
And who is sufficient for these things?
 Do we begin again to commend ourselves?
"or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?"
" But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:  How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?"
 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
and what communion hath light with darkness?
 And what concord hath Christ with Belial?
or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?
 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance?
" Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
 Wherefore?
because I love you not?
 Are they Hebrews?
Are they Israelites?
Are they the seed of Abraham?
 Are they ministers of Christ?
" Who is weak, and I am not weak?"
"who is offended, and I burn not?"
" For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you?"
 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
Did Titus make a gain of you?
walked we not in the same spirit?
walked we not in the same steps?
" Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?"
"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"
" For do I now persuade men, or God?"
or do I seek to please men?
" But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
" But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin?"
" O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
" This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
 Are ye so foolish?
"having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
 Have ye suffered so many things in vain?
" He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
 Wherefore then serveth the law?
 Is the law then against the promises of God?
" But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?
" Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
" Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
 Nevertheless what saith the scripture?
 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
" And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?"
" (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
 What then?
"  Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,   (Touch not; taste not; handle not;   Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?"
" For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?"
Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
" For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;  Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
" Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
" For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;  Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
" For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?"
"And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
" But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
" Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
" For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;  How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;  God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"
" But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him?"
or the son of man that thou visitest him?
 But with whom was he grieved forty years?
"was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"
" And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
" If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
" For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
 For then would they not have ceased to be offered?
" He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"
 And what shall I more say?
" If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
" Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
" For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;  And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:  Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
" Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
"Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
" What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?"
can faith save him?
" If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?"
" But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
" Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
" Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
" Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"
 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
" Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries?"
"either a vine, figs?"
 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?
 From whence come wars and fightings among you?
"come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"
" Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?"
" Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
" There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"
For what is your life?
 Is any among you afflicted?
Is any merry?
 Is any sick among you?
" For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently?"
" And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?"
" For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
" And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
" This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:  That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:  Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,  And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?"
" Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?
And wherefore slew he him?
" But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"
" If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"
" Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
" And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?"
" And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:  And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
" And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"
" And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes?"
and whence came they?
" And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast?"
who is able to make war with him?
" Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?"
" And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel?"

"The Master said, ""If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man?"

How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them?
Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them?
"Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon?"
"The Master replied, ""When the person in authority makes more  beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent without great expenditure?"
"When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine?"
"When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness?"

Wherefore didst thou not wake me?
"for if thou hadst been overcome, who, I pray thee, could have borne my weight into Mazinderan, whither I must hie me to deliver the Shah?"
"Then the dragon said- ""What is thy name, and who art thou that dost venture against me?"
"Then one of those who stood about the Shah said unto him- ""Is it known to thee, O Shah, that this King hideth behind his curtains a daughter of beauty?"
"If thou wert satisfied with Iran, wherefore didst thou venture  afield?"
"And when he had found him he gave rein unto his anger, and he rebuked him for his follies, and he said- ""Hath the world seen the like of this man?"
Hath a more foolish head sat upon the throne of Iran?
"Thrice hast thou now fallen into mishap, and who can tell whether thy spirit hath yet learned wisdom?"
"To all men are known the deeds of Rustem, and since my birth be thus noble, wherefore hast thou kept it dark from me so long?"
"Then Gurdafrid, full of wile, turned unto him her face that was unveiled, for she beheld no other means of safety, and she said unto him- ""O hero without flaw, is it well that thou shouldest seek to make me captive, and show me unto the army?"
"And he said- ""Who shall stand against this Turk?"
"And he said- ""Who is Rustem, that he defieth my power and disregardeth my commands?"
What is this Kai Kaous that he should anger me?
and what am I that I have need of him?

"Then Sohrab said, ""Whose is the camp in which stand many warriors clad in rich armour?"
"Then Sohrab said, ""To whom belongeth the tent draped with green tissues?"
"Then Sohrab said, ""Whose is the seat over which are raised awnings and brocades of Roum, that glisten with gold in the sunlight?"
What recketh my life against the weal of Iran?
"So he said- ""Why seekest thou to know Rustem the Pehliva?"
"And Sohrab bare in his hands a mighty club, and the garb of battle was upon him; but his mouth was full of smiles, and he asked of Rustem how he had rested, and he said- ""Wherefore hast thou prepared thy heart for battle?"
"Then Sohrab said, ""O man of many years, wherefore wilt thou not listen to the counsel of a stripling?"
"But Sohrab came  forth like a giant refreshed, and he ran at Rustem like to a mad elephant,  and he cried with a voice of thunder- ""O thou who didst flee from battle, wherefore art thou come out once more against me?"
"And he said- ""Bearest thou about thee a token of Rustem, that I may know that the words which thou speakest are true?"
"For he said, ""How can I come before  Ormuzd if I depart from mine oath?"
"Wouldst thou lift thine hand against thine offspring, and hast thou not done enough that is evil?"
"And he said- ""Young shepherd, how knowest thou the day from the night?"
What doest thou with thy flocks?

"Then Gudarz said, ""What companions wilt thou take with thee?"
Are they happy?
"And when she beheld the army she woke them and bade them prepare for combat; but Gew suffered not that Kai Khosrau should go forth, for he said- ""If I fall, what mattereth that?"
"So he said- ""Why should I carry thee across?"
"And he came before Kai Kaous and said- ""Friburz is thy son also, why therefore wilt thou give the crown unto one who is sprung from the race of Afrasiyab?"
"Then Kai Kaous said, ""Ye ask of me that which is hard, for both my sons are dear unto me, and how should I choose between them?"
"And when Tus came up he said unto Gudarz- ""The desert is void of water, and what shall we do deprived thereof, for the army sore needeth refreshment after its march of weariness?"
"Now Firoud, beholding him, said unto Tokhareh, ""Who is he that cometh out with so haughty an air?"
"Now Bahram, when he had neared the summit, lifted up his voice, that was like unto thunder, and cried, saying- ""Who art thou that seatest thyself upon the heights and lookest down upon the army?"
"Thinkest thou, perchance, that I am but a wild ass of the desert, and that thou art a lion, great of might?"
"Then Firoud said unto him- ""Why hast thou not spoken the name of Bahram?"
"But Firoud answered in anger, ""Who is Tus, that I should fear him?"
"Moreover, the army will come forth to avenge him, and how canst thou stand against an host?"
"And the nobles, when they beheld their Pehliva treated thus with contempt,- were angry also, and Gew said- ""Who is this young man, that he despiseth an army, and how may he treat us with disdain?"
"Then Piran made haste to come before Afrasiyab, and he spake to him and said- ""The land is changed into a sea of blood, for Rustem is come forth, and who can stand against him?"
"Wherefore I counsel thee, flee; for how canst thou stand alone against him?"
"And the Deev, when he beheld that Rustem was awakened, spake, and said unto him- ""O hero, which death dost thou covet?"
"And when she learned that it was men of Iran who were come forth, she made her way unto the city, and came before Rustem and questioned him, saying- ""What news is there abroad in Iran concerning Byzun, the son of Gew, and doth no army come forth to save him?"
Why therefore should I weary me in his cause?
"But Isfendiyar was angered at these words, and he said- ""Wilt thou never cease from speaking?"
How shall a man escape from that which is written; How shall he flee from  his destiny?
"But Shugdad  said- ""Wherefore dost thou take forth so large an army?"
"And when he beheld Rustem, that weltered in his blood, he feigned a great sorrow, and he cried- ""O hero of renown, what thing hath befallen thee?"
"And he said- ""Wherefore have I been suffered to see this day?"
"Wherefore have I not died before Rustem, my son?"

"Is it ye who send it down from the clouds, or send we it down?"
"Brackish could we make it, if we pleased: will ye not then be thankful?"
What think ye?
"The fire which ye obtain by friction-  Is it ye who rear its tree, or do we rear it?"
Such tidings as these will ye disdain?
Will ye make it your daily bread to gainsay them?
"Why, at the moment when the soul of a dying man shall come up into his throat,  And when ye are gazing at him,  Though we are nearer to him than ye, although ye see us not:  Why do ye not, if ye are to escape the judgement,  Cause that soul to return?"
will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw?
"Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza,  And Manat the third idol besides?"
What?
shall ye have male progeny and God female?
Shall man have whatever he wisheth?
Hast thou considered him who turned his back?
Who giveth little and is covetous?
Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things?
Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses?
And of Abraham faithful to his pledge?
Is it at these sayings that ye marvel?
And that ye laugh and weep not?
And that ye are triflers?
"But what hath come to the unbelievers that they run at full stretch around thee,  On the right hand and on the left, in bands?"
Is it that every man of them would fain enter that garden of delights?
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will ye twain deny?
Shall the reward of good be aught but good?
"And we left it a sign: but, is there any one who receives the warning?"
"Easy for warning have we made the Koran-but, is there any one who receives the warning?"
"The tribe of Themoud treated the threatenings as lies:  And they said, ""Shall we follow a single man from among ourselves?"
To him alone among us is the office of warning entrusted?
"Easy have we made the Koran for warning-but, is there any one who receives the warning?"
"Are your infidels, O Meccans, better men than these?"
Is there an exemption for you in the sacred Books?
"Of old, too, have we destroyed the like of you-yet is any one warned?"
"Ask the Meccans then, Are they, or the angels whom we have made, the stronger creation?"
"when dead, and turned to dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised?"
"Saith one of them, ""I truly had a bosom friend,  Who said, 'Art thou of those who credit it?"
"""But do we not die,"" say the blessed,  ""Any other than our first death?"
and have we escaped the torment?
Is this the better repast or the tree Ez-zakkoum?
"And truly, of his faith was Abraham,  When he brought to his Lord a perfect heart,  When he said to his father and to his people, ""What is this ye worship?"
Prefer ye with falsehood gods to God?
"He went aside to their gods and said, ""Do ye not eat?"
"And Elias truly was of our Sent Ones,  When he said to his people, ""Fear ye not God?"
Invoke ye Baal and forsake ye the most skilful Creator?
And ye indeed pass by their ruined dwellings at morn  And night: will ye not then reflect?
"Inquire then of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they, sons?"
Have we created the angels females?
and did they witness it?
"Is it not a falsehood of their own devising, when they say,  ""God hath begotten""?"
Would he have preferred daughters to sons?
What reason have ye for thus judging?
Will ye not then receive this warning?
Have ye a clear proof for them?
Would they then hasten our vengeance?
and are we not among the punished?
"He will send down the very Heaven upon you in plenteous rains;  And will increase you in wealth and children; and will give you gardens, and will give you watercourses:  What hath come to you that ye hope not for goodness from the hand of God?"
For He it is who hath formed you by successive steps.  See ye not how God hath created the seven heavens one over the other?
"Are they better than the people of Tobba,  And those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil deeds?"
when dead and turned to dust shall we?
"Will they not look up to the heaven above them, and consider how we have reared it and decked it forth, and that there are no flaws therein?"
Are we wearied out with the first creation?
"And it shall say, ""Are there more?"
Is there any escape?
is there any addition?
Hath the history of Moses reached thee?
"When thy sister went and said, 'Shall I shew you one who will nurse him?"
"""But what,"" said he, ""was the state of generations past?"
"He said, ""Hast thou come, O Moses, to drive us from our land by thine enchantments?"
"Said Pharaoh, ""Believe ye on him ere I give you leave?"
did not your Lord promise you a good promise?
Was the time of my absence long to you?
"saw they not that it returned them no answer, and could neither hurt nor help them?"
"when thou sawest that they had gone astray, what hindered thee from following me?"
"why hast thou assembled me with others, blind?"
"Are not they, who walk the very places where they dwelt, aware how many generations we have destroyed before them?"
"But have not clear proofs for the Koran come to them, in what is in the Books of old?"
Have they not beheld the earth-how we have caused every kind of noble plant to spring up therein?
"He said, ""Did we not rear thee among us when a child?"
And hast thou not passed years of thy life among us?
"Said Pharaoh, ""Have ye then believed on him ere I gave you leave?"
"He said, ""Can they hear you when ye cry to them?"
"He said, ""How think ye?"
"And it shall be said to them, 'Where are they whom ye worshipped  Beside God?"
"The people of Noah gainsaid the Apostles,  When their brother Noah said to them, ""Will ye not fear God?"
"The Adites treated their Apostles as liars,  When their brother Houd said to them, ""Will ye not fear God?"
build ye landmarks on all heights in mere pastime?
And raise ye structures to be your lasting abodes?
And when ye put forth your power do ye put it forth with harshness?
"The Themoudites also treated their Apostles as liars,  When their brother Saleh said to them, ""Will ye not fear God?"
Shall ye be left secure amid these things here?
"Amid gardens and fountains,  And corn-fields and palm-trees, with flower-sheathing branches?"
"And, insolent that ye are, will ye hew out your dwellings in the mountains?"
"The people of Lot treated their apostles as liars,  When their brother Lot said to them, ""Will ye not fear God?"
"with men, of all creatures, will ye have commerce?"
And leave ye your wives whom your Lord hath created for you?
"When Shoaib their brother said to them, ""Will ye not fear God?"
Was it not a sign to them that the learned among the children of Israel recognised it?
"In such sort have we influenced the heart of the wicked ones,  That they will not believe it till they see the grievous chastisement?"
will they seek to hasten on our chastisement?
How thinkest thou?
"If after we have given them their fill for years,  That with which they are menaced come upon them at last,  Of what avail will their enjoyments be to them?"
Shall I tell you on whom Satan descend?
It is the poets whom the erring follow:  Seest thou not how they rove distraught in every valley?
And that they say that which they do not?
"He said, ""Bring ye me such tidings now that old age hath come upon me?"
"They said, ""Have we not forbidden thee to entertain any one whatever?"
"She said: ""How shall I have a son, when man hath never touched me?"
"why dost thou worship that which neither seeth nor heareth, nor profiteth thee aught?"
"He said, ""Castest thou off my Gods, O Abraham?"
"Doth not man bear in mind that we made him at first, when he was nought?"
"And when our clear signs are rehearsed to them, the infidels say to those who believe: ""Which of the two parties is in the best plight?"
Hath he mounted up into the secrets of God?
Hath he made a compact with the God of Mercy?
Seest thou not that we send the Satans against the Infidels to urge them into sin?
Canst thou search out one of them?
or canst thou hear a whisper from them?
"And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come to them; and the Infidels say, ""This is a sorcerer, a liar:  Maketh he the gods to be but one god?"
"Are the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the bounteous, in their hands?"
Is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them theirs?
"Hath the story of the two pleaders reached thee, O Muhammad, when they mounted the walls of his closet?"
Shall we treat those who believe and do the things that are right like those who propagate evil on earth?
Shall we treat the God-fearing like the impious?
"And they will say: ""Why see we not the men whom we numbered among the wicked-  Whom we used to treat with scorn?"
"""O Eblis,"" said God, ""what hindereth thee from prostrating thyself before him whom my hands have made?"
Is it that thou are puffed up with pride?
"And why should I not worship Him who made me, and to whom ye shall be brought back?"
Shall I take gods beside Him?
See they not how many generations we have destroyed before them?
Will they not therefore be thankful?
"And when it is said to them, Give alms of what God hath bestowed on you, they who believe not say to the believers, ""Shall we feed him whom God can feed if He will?"
who hath roused us from our sleeping place?
"Did I not enjoin on you, O sons of Adam, 'Worship not Satan, for that he is your declared foe,'  But 'Worship Me: this is a right path'?"
Did ye not then comprehend?
"And, if we pleased, we would surely put out their eyes: yet even then would they speed on with rivalry in their path: but how should they see?"
Will they not understand?
"See they not that we have created for them among the things which our hands have wrought, the animals of which they are masters?"
And that we have subjected them unto them?
Doth not man perceive that we have created him of the moist germs of life?
must not He who hath created the Heavens and the Earth be mighty enough to create your likes?
"We have made it an Arabic Koran that ye may understand:  And it is a transcript of the archetypal Book, kept by us; it is lofty, filled with wisdom,  Shall we then turn aside this warning from you because ye are a people who transgress?"
"Hath God adopted daughters from among those whom he hath created, and chosen sons for you?"
"make they a being to be the offspring of God who is brought up among trinkets, and is ever contentious without reason?"
did they witness their creation?
Have we ere this given them a Book? and do they possess it still?
"Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or guide the blind and him who is in palpable error?"
"Whether therefore we take thee off by death, surely will we avenge ourselves on them;  Or whether we make thee a witness of the accomplishment of that with which we threatened them, we will surely gain the mastery over them.  Hold thou fast therefore what hath been revealed to thee, for thou art on a right path:  For truly to thee and to thy people it is an admonition; and ye shall have an account to render for it at last.  And ask our Sent Ones whom we have sent before thee,  ""Appointed we gods beside the God of Mercy whom they should worship?"
"is not the kingdom of Egypt mine, and these rivers which flow at my feet? Do ye not behold?"
"Am I not mightier than this despicable fellow,  And who scarce can speak distinctly?"
"thy people cried out for joy thereat:  And they said, ""Are our gods or is he the better?"
Think they that we hear not their secrets and their private talk?
How then hold they false opinions?
"), as if they had said, ""Jesus is worshipped as a God by the Christians: does he come under your anathema equally with our idols?"
Who hath created seven Heavens one above another: No defect canst thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze: seest thou a single flaw?
shall He not know who hath created?
are ye sure that He who is in Heaven will not cleave the Earth beneath you?
Or are ye sure that He who is in Heaven will not send against you a stone- charged whirlwind?
"Behold they not the birds over their heads, outstretching and drawing in their wings?"
"Who is he that can be as an army to you, to succour you, except the God of Mercy?"
"Or who is he that will furnish you supplies, if He withhold His supplies?"
"Is he who goeth along grovelling on his face, better guided than he who goeth upright on a straight path?"
SAY: What think ye?
"Whether God destroy me or not, and those who follow me, or whether he have mercy on us, yet who will protect the infidels from a woeful torment?"
SAY: What think ye?
"If at early morn your waters shall have sunk away, who then will give you clear running water?"
serve God: ye have no other God than He: will ye not therefore fear Him?
"doth he foretell you, that after ye shall be dead and become dust and bones, ye shall be brought forth?"
"think they that what we largely, bestow on them of wealth and children,  We hasten to them for their good?"
Do they not then heed the things spoken-whether that hath come to them which came not to their fathers of old?
Or do they not recognise their apostle; and therefore disavow him?
Dost thou ask them for remuneration?
"And it is He who maketh alive and killeth, and of Him is the change of the night and of the day: Will ye not understand?"
"When we shall be dead, and have become dust and bones, shall we, indeed, be waked to life?"
"SAY: Whose is the earth, and all that is therein; if ye know?"
"SAY: Will ye not, then reflect?"
"SAY: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the glorious throne?"
"SAY: Will ye not, then, fear Him?"
"SAY: In whose hand is the empire of all things, who protecteth but is not protected?"
"SAY: How, then, can ye be so spell-bound?"
Were not my signs rehearsed unto you?
"Every fresh warning that cometh to them from their Lord they only hear to mock it,  Their hearts set on lusts: and they who have done this wrong say in secret discourse, ""Is He more than a man like yourselves?"
"Before their time, none of the cities which we have destroyed, believed: will these men, then, believe?"
"And now have we sent down to you ""the book,"" in which is your warning: What, will ye not then understand?"
"All beings in the heaven and on the earth are His: and they who are in his presence disdain not his service, neither are they wearied:  They praise Him night and day: they rest not.  Have they taken gods from the earth who can quicken the dead?"
Have they taken other gods beside Him?
"Do not the infidels see that the heavens and the earth were both a solid mass, and that we clave them asunder, and that by means of water we give life to everything?"
Will they not then believe?
"At no time have we granted to man a life that shall last for ever: if thou then die, shall they live for ever?"
"They say, ""When will this threat be made good?"
SAY: Who shall protect you by night and by day from the God of Mercy?
Have they gods beside Us who can defend them?
see they not that we come to a land and straiten its borders Is it they who are the conquerors?
And this Koran which we have sent down is a blessed warning: will ye then disown it?
"They said, ""Hast thou come unto us in earnest?"
"They said, ""Who hath done this to our gods?"
"do ye then worship, instead of God, that which doth not profit you at all, nor injure you?"
"And we taught David the art of making mail for you, to defend you from each other's violence: will ye therefore be thankful?"
SAY: Verily it hath been revealed to me that your God is one God; are ye then resigned to Him?
"And they say, ""What sort of apostle is this?"
"SAY: Is this, or the Paradise of Eternity which was promised to the God- fearing, best?"
Will ye be steadfast?
Have they not seen it?
Is this he whom God has sent as an Apostle?
What thinkest thou?
He who hath taken his passions as a god-wilt thou be a guardian over him?
Thinkest thou that the greater part of them hear or understand?
"But when it is said to them, ""Bow down before the God of Mercy,"" they say, ""Who is the God of Mercy?"
"hath your Lord prepared sons for you, and taken for himself daughters from among the angels?"
"said he, ""shall I bow me before him whom thou hast created of clay?"
Seest thou this man whom thou hast honoured above me?
"are ye sure, then, that he will not cleave the sides of the earth for you?"
or that he will not send against you a whirlwind charged with sands?
"Or are ye sure that he will not cause you to put back to sea a second time, and send against you a storm blast, and drown you, for that ye have been thankless?"
"Am I more than a man, an apostle?"
"Do they not perceive that God, who created the Heavens and the Earth, is able to create their like?"
SAY: Believe ye therein or believe ye not?
"And he reviewed the birds, and said, ""How is it that I see not the lapwing?"
Is it one of the absent?
"And when the messenger came to Solomon, he said, ""Aid ye me with riches?"
"Said he, ""O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me, submitting?"
proceed ye to such filthiness with your eyes open?
come ye with lust unto men rather than to women?
Is God the more worthy or the gods they join with Him?
A god with God?
a god with God?
"Is not He the more worthy who answereth the oppressed when they cry to him, and taketh off their ills, and maketh you to succeed your sires on the earth?"
a god with God?
"Is not He, who guideth you in the darkness of the land and of the sea, and who sendeth forth the winds as the forerunners of His mercy?"
a god with God?
"Is not He, who created a Being, then reneweth it, and who supplieth you out of the Heaven and the Earth?"
a god with God?
"And the unbelievers say: ""When we and our fathers have been dead shall we be taken forth?"
"And on that day shall be gathered out of every nation a company of those who have gainsaid our signs, in separate bands;  Till they come before God, who will say, ""Treated ye my signs as impostures, although ye embraced them not in your knowledge?"
or what is it that ye were doing?
"See they not that we have ordained the night that they may rest in it, and the day with its gift of light?"
Shall ye be rewarded but as ye have wrought?
Hast thou reflected that the Inmates of THE CAVE and of Al Rakim were on our wondrous signs?
"These our people have taken other gods beside Him, though they bring no clear proof for them; but, who more iniquitous than he who forgeth a lie of God?"
"hast thou no belief in him who created thee of the dust, then of the germs of life, then fashioned thee a perfect man?"
what meaneth this Book?
will ye then take him and his offspring as patrons rather than Me?
and they your enemies?
"And what, now that guidance is come to them, letteth men from believing and from asking forgiveness of their Lord-unless they wait till that the doom of the ancients overtake them, or the chastisement come upon them in the sight of the universe?"
But who is worse than he who when told of the signs of his Lord turneth him away and forgetteth what in time past his hands have wrought?
"He said, ""What thinkest thou?"
"said Moses, ""hast thou staved it in that thou mayest drown its crew?"
"Said Moses, ""Hast thou slain him who is free from guilt of blood?"
"do the infidels think that they can take my servants as their patrons, beside Me?"
SAY: Shall we tell you who they are that have lost their labour most?
"Whose aim in the present life hath been mistaken, and who deem that what they do is right?"
"Will they say, He hath forged it?"
Will ye not then reflect?
Shall he then who is a believer be as he who sinneth grossly?
"Who acteth worse than he who is warned by the signs of his Lord, then turneth away from them?"
"Is it not notorious to them how many generations, through whose abodes they walk, we have destroyed before them?"
Truly herein are sings: will they not then hear?
See they not how we drive the rain to some parched land and thereby bring forth corn of which their cattle and themselves do eat?
Will they not then behold?
"They say, ""When will this decision take place?"
SAY: Do ye indeed disbelieve in Him who in two days created the earth?
and do ye assign Him peers?
Saw they not that God their creator was mightier than they in prowess?
"And who speaketh fairer than he who biddeth to God and doth the thing that is right, and saith, ""I for my part am of the Muslims""?"
"Is he then who shall be cast into the fire, or he who shall come forth secure on the day of resurrection, in the better position?"
in a foreign tongue?
SAY: What think ye?
"If this Book be from God and ye believe it not, who will have gone further astray than he who is at a distance from it?"
Is it not enough for thee that thy Lord is witness of all things?
Are they not in doubt as to the meeting with their Lord?
But doth he not encompass all things?
foreign and Arabian?
"But in what teaching will they believe, if they reject God and his signs?"
"Deem they whose gettings are only evil, that we will deal with them as with those who believe and work righteousness, so that their lives and deaths shall be alike?"
What thinkest thou?
"He who hath made a God of his passions, and whom God causeth wilfully to err, and whose ears and whose heart he hath sealed up, and over whose sight he hath placed a veil-who, after his rejection by God, shall guide such a one?"
Will ye not then be warned?
"But as to the Infidels-""Were not my signs recited to you?"
Shall He then who hath created be as he who hath not created?
Will ye not consider?
Shall it not be a grievous burden for them?
"What can the infidels expect but that the angels of death come upon them, or that a sentence of thy Lord take effect?"
Yet is the duty of the apostles other than public preaching?
"Are they then who have plotted mischiefs, sure that God will not cause the earth to cleave under them?"
or that a chastisement will not come upon them whence they looked not for it?
"Or that He will not seize upon them in their comings and goings, while they shall not be able to resist him?"
Or that he will not seize them with some slowly wasting scourge?
"Have they not seen how everything which God hath created turneth its shadow right and left, prostrating itself before God in all abasement?"
Will ye then fear any other than God?
"But they desire them not for themselves:  For when the birth of a daughter is announced to any one of them, dark shadows settle on his face, and he is sad:  He hideth him from the people because of the ill tidings: shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it in the dust? Are not their judgments wrong?"
"will they deny, then, that these boons are from God?"
"What, will they then believe in vain idols?"
Shall they be held equal?
"Shall he and the man who enjoineth what is just, and keepeth in the straight path, be held equal?"
Have they never looked up at the birds subjected to Him in Heaven's vault?
Unde venisti?
"Have they not considered within themselves that God hath not created the Heavens and the Earth and all that is between them but for a serious end, and for a fixed term?"
"Have they never journeyed through the land, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them?"
"Have ye among the slaves whom your right hands have won, any partner in what we have bestowed on you, so that ye share alike?"
Fear ye them as ye fear each other?
"But the wicked, devoid of knowledge, follow their own desires: and those whom God shall mislead, who shall guide, and who shall be their protector?"
Have we sent down to them any mandate which speaketh in favour of what they join with God?
See they not that God bestoweth full supplies on whom He pleaseth and giveth sparingly to whom He pleaseth?
Is there any of your companion-gods who can do aught of these things?
"Do they not doubly fold up their breasts, that they may hide themselves from Him?"
"But when they enshroud themselves in their garments, doth He not know alike what they conceal and what they shew?"
will it not come upon them on a day when there shall be none to avert it from them?
Are ye then Muslims?
With such can they be compared who rest upon clear proofs from their Lord?
"to whom a witness from him reciteth the Koran, and who is preceded by the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy?"
Who is guilty of a greater injustice than he who inventeth a lie concerning God?
"Shall not the malison of God be on these unjust doers,  Who pervert others from the way of God, and seek to make it crooked, and believe not in a life to come?"
"These two sorts of persons resemble the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing: shall these be compared as alike?"
do ye not comprehend?
how think you?
"If I am upon a clear revelation from my Lord, who hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself to which ye are blind, can we force it on you, if ye are averse from it?"
"were I to drive them away, who shall help me against God?"
Will ye not therefore consider?
Will ye not then understand?
"Was not Ad, the people of Houd, cast far away?"
our hopes were fixed on thee till now: forbiddest thou us to worship what our fathers worshipped?
what think ye?
"If I have a revelation from my Lord to support me, and if He hath shewed his mercy on me, who could protect me from God if I rebel against him?"
Did not Themoud disbelieve his Lord?
Was not Themoud utterly cast off?
"shall I bear a son when I am old, and when this my husband is an old man?"
"They said, ""Marvellest thou at the command of God?"
"is it thy prayers which enjoin that we should leave what our fathers worshipped, or that we should not do with our substance as pleaseth us?"
How think ye?
"If I have a clear revelation from my Lord, and if from Himself He hath supplied me with goodly supplies, and if I will not follow you in that which I myself forbid you, do I seek aught but your amendment so far as in me lieth?"
think ye more highly of my family than of God?
"Cast ye Him behind your back, with neglect?"
Was not Madian swept off even as Themoud had been swept off?
"Were the generations before you, endued with virtue, and who forbad corrupt doings on the earth, more than a few of those whom we delivered?"
"Hath not the story reached you of those who were before you, the people of Noah, and Ad, and Themoud,  And of those who lived after them?"
Seest thou not that in truth hath God created the Heavens and the Earth?
"Hast thou not beholden those who repay the goodness of God with infidelity, and sink their people into the abode of perdition-  Hell?"
"""Did ye not once swear that no change should befal you?"
why dost thou not entrust us with Joseph?
"are sundry lords best, or God, the One, the Mighty?"
"See ye not that I fill the measure, and am the best of hosts?"
"He said, ""Shall I entrust you with him otherwise than as I before entrusted you with his brother?"
"They said, ""O, our father, what more can we desire?"
"The eldest of them said, ""Know ye not how that your father hath taken a pledge from you before God, and how formerly ye failed in duty with regard to Joseph?"
"Are they sure that the overwhelming chastisement of God shall not come upon them, or that that Hour shall not come upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?"
"Will they not journey through the land, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them?"
Will they not then comprehend?
With whom shall be the power supreme on that day?
"Have they never journeyed in this land, and seen what hath been the end of those who flourished before them?"
"And a man of the family of Pharaoh, who was a BELIEVER, but hid his faith, said, ""Will ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when he hath already come to you with proofs of his mission from your Lord?"
"how is it that I bid you to salvation, but that ye bid me to the fire?"
"This is God your Lord, Creator of all things: no god is there but He: why then do ye turn away from Him?"
Seest thou not those who cavil at the signs of God?
"It is God who hath given you the cattle that on some of them ye may ride, and of some may eat:  (Other advantages too do ye derive from them)-and that by them ye may effect the projects ye cherish in your breasts; for on them, and on ships are ye borne:  And He sheweth you His signs: which, then, of the signs of God will ye deny?"
"Have they not journeyed in this land, and seen what hath been the end of those who flourished before them?"
"And we caused him to refuse the nurses, until his sister came and said, Shall I point out to you the family of a house that will rear him for you, and will be careful of him?"
"And when he would have laid violent hands on him who was their common foe, he said to him, ""O Moses, dost thou desire to slay me, as thou slayedst a man yesterday?"
why hast thou not sent an Apostle to us?
""" But did they not disbelieve in what of old was given to Moses?"
"And if they answer thee not, then know that verily they are following their own caprices: and who goeth more widely astray than he who followeth his own caprice without guidance from God?"
"But have we not established for them a sacred secure precinct, to which fruits of every kind, our gift for their support, are gathered together?"
Will ye not be wise?
"Shall he then to whom we have promised a goodly promise and who obtaineth it, be as he on whom we have bestowed the enjoyments of this life present, and who on the day of Resurrection shall be brought up for punishment?"
SAY: What think ye?
"If God should enshroud you with a long night until the day of resurrection, what god beside God would bring you light?"
Will ye not then hearken?
SAY: What think ye?
"If God should make it one long day for you until the day of resurrection, what god but God could bring you the night in which to take your rest?"
Will ye not then see?
"One day God will call to them and say, ""Where are my companions as ye supposed them?"
Did he not know that God had destroyed before him generations that were mightier than he in strength and had amassed more abundant wealth?
" ""Why must the nurse be a Hebrew woman?"
"We have sent down the Book to thee with the truth: serve thou God then, and be sincere in thy worship:  Is not a sincere worship due to God?"
"Is He not the Mighty, the Gracious?"
How then are ye so turned aside from Him?

Why is this so?
How can this be?
"If you are correct in insisting that what is without sentiency is without buddha-nature, then the sutra ought not to say, ‘The three realms are mind-only, the ten thousand dharmas are consciousness-only.’ Hence the Avataṃsaka Sutra says, ‘Every existent dharma in the three realms is only mindcreated.’ Now on the other hand, let me ask you, do things without sentiency exist inside the three realms or outside them?"

To whom was the true dharma transmitted?

"The Guanxin lun presents Shenxiu’s teachings on the central importance of meditation: “Question: If a person wanted to seek the enlightenment of buddhahood, what would be the most quintessential dharma he could cultivate?"

"To this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded to the question: What is justice, stripped of appearances?"
"Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, to Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the State?"
"Who better suited to raise the question of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem to be the expression of it?"
"But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?"
And are you stronger than all these?
"May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let us go?"
"But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you?"
Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
Will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race?
"And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age': is life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?"
"How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles, are you still the man you were?"
"May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part inherited or acquired by you?"
"Acquired, Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired?"
"Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?"
What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?
"Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is it?"
"To speak the truth and to pay your debts, no more than this?"
And even to this are there not exceptions?
"Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him?"
Is not Polemarchus your heir?
"Socrates - POLEMARCHUS   Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, and according to you truly say, about justice?"
Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no means to make the return?
"When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did not mean to include that case?"
"You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a debt, that is what you would imagine him to say?"
And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
"I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would make to us?"
"And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?"
"And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?"
That is his meaning then?
And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness?
"Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?"
And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends?
"But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a physician?"
And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?
Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?
You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?
Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?
"Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, that is what you mean?"
And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace?
And by contracts you mean partnerships?
But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner at a game of draughts?
And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better partner than the builder?
"Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a better partner than the just man?"
"Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse; a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would he not?"
"And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be better?"
Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to be preferred?
"You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?"
"That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?"
"And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful to the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the art of the vine-dresser?"
"And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then the art of the soldier or of the musician?"
"And so of all the other things; justice is useful when they are useless, and useless when they are useful?"
But let us consider this further point: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?
And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?
And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march upon the enemy?
Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?
"And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies,' that was what you were saying?"
"Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean those who are so really, or only in seeming?"
"Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not good seem to be so, and conversely?"
Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?
And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?
But the good are just and would not do an injustice?
Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no wrong?
Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust?
"What was the error, Polemarchus?"
And how is the error to be corrected?
You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?
"And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil?"
But ought the just to injure any one at all?
"When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?"
"Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of dogs?"
"And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of horses?"
And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the proper virtue of man?
And that human virtue is justice?
Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?
But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?
Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?
"And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?"
Any more than heat can produce cold?
Or drought moisture?
Nor can the good harm any one?
And the just is the good?
"Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?"
"Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man or seer?"
Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?
Whose?
"Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what other can be offered?"
"Socrates, has taken possession of you all?"
"And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one another?"
"And why, when we are seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at the truth?"
"Did I not foresee have I not already told you, that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?"
"But suppose that he were to retort, Thrasymachus, what do you mean?"
"If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is not the right one?"
is that your meaning?
How would you answer him?
Why should they not be?
"I replied; and even if they are not, but only appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?"
I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?
"But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he said, than any of these?"
What do you deserve to have done to you?
"Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and says that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them?"
"Will you then kindly answer, for the edification of the company and of myself ?"
And now why do you not me?
"What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?"
"You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is, and right and just for us?"
"Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?"
And the government is the ruling power in each state?
"I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or subjects to obey their rulers?"
"But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes liable to err?"
"Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and sometimes not?"
"When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest; when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?"
"And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, and that is what you call justice?"
"Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the interest of the stronger but the reverse?"
What is that you are saying?
"But let us consider: Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?"
Has not that been admitted?
"For if, as you say, justice is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the stronger?"
"Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?"
Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?
"Do you mean, for example, that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?"
"or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake?"
"Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an informer?"
And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring you in the argument?
"I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term?"
"And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and cheat, Thrasymachus?"
"It will be better that I should ask you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money?"
"And the pilot that is to say, the true pilot is he a captain of sailors or a mere sailor?"
"Now, I said, every art has an interest?"
For which the art has to consider and provide?
And the interest of any art is the perfection of it this and nothing else?
What do you mean?
Am I not right?
"But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself, I say, any similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and another without end?"
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests?
Or have they no need either of themselves or of another?
"Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest of the body?"
"Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which is the subject of their art?"
"But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects?"
"Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and weaker?"
"Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?"
"And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of sailors and not a mere sailor?"
"And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's interest?"
"When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus, instead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a nurse?"
"Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?"
What makes you say that?
And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not?
Is the attempt to determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage?
"And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?"
"And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced by what I have just said; what more can I do for you?"
Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls?
"Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage not of themselves but of others?"
"Let me ask you a question: Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?"
"And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and so on?"
"You would not be inclined to say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language?"
Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine?
Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?
"And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially confined to the art?"
"Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common use?"
"And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed by him?"
"The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?"
But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?
"What do you mean, Socrates?"
You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule?
"Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?"
Which of us has spoken truly?
"And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?"
Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was rehearsing?
"Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he is saying what is not true?"
And which method do I understand you to prefer?
You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect justice?
And what is your view about them?
Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice?
I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?
What else then would you say?
And would you call justice vice?
Then would you call injustice malignity?
And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?
"I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?"
"Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good as answer yet one more question?"
Does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just?
And would he try to go beyond just action?
And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?
"My question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?"
"And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?"
"We may put the matter thus, I said the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike?"
"And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?"
And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?
"Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?"
"Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts: you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?"
And which is wise and which is foolish?
"And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is foolish?"
And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?
"And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings?"
But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?
And what would you say of the physician?
In prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine?
But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?
Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?
And what of the ignorant?
would he not desire to have more than either the knowing or the ignorant?
And the knowing is wise?
And the wise is good?
"Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but more than his unlike and opposite?"
Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?
"But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his like and unlike?"
Were not these your words?
And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his unlike?
"Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and ignorant?"
And each of them is such as his like is?
"As we were now agreed that justice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to another point:   Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?"
What else would you have?
"But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in subjection?"
"You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to inform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured one another?"
"But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act together better?"
"And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, Thrasymachus?"
"How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice, having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at variance and render them incapable of common action?"
"And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power?"
"Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just?"
Is not this the case?
"And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just?"
"Is not that true, Thrasymachus?"
"And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?"
"But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will be their friend?"
I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse has some end?
"And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?"
"Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?"
"Or hear, except with the ear?"
These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?
"But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and in many other ways?"
And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?
May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?
"Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?"
And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence?
Need I ask again whether the eye has an end?
And has not the eye an excellence?
And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end and a special excellence?
"Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead?"
"How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?"
"I would rather ask the question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall of fulfilling them by their own defect?"
I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper excellence they cannot fulfil their end?
And the same observation will apply to all other things?
Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil?
"Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?"
And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?
And has not the soul an excellence also?
And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that excellence?
"Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent, and the good soul a good ruler?"
"And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?"
"Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?"
"And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the reverse of happy?"
"Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?"
"So he said to me: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?"
"Let me ask you now: How would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows from them?"
"Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight, health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their results?"
"And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of money-making these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them?"
But why do you ask?
Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice?
Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?
"Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the isolation to be effected?"
"Adeimantus -SOCRATES   I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged?"
"Why, what else is there?"
Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why?
"He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates, those of them, I mean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life?"
Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of Pindar   Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days?
But what if there are no gods?
"or, suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment?"
"On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?"
"Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised?"
"Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry?"
And is not a State larger than an individual?
But ought we to attempt to construct one?
Can any other origin of a State be imagined?
"And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants?"
And how will they proceed?
Will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock?
"the individual husbandman, for example, producing for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three-fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?"
"And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations, or when he has only one?"
"Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?"
"Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?"
Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city?
Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?
"Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?"
Then we shall want merchants?
"And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will also be needed, and in considerable numbers?"
"Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?"
"Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him, is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?"
"Is not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants?"
Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
"And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?"
"Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the State did they spring up?"
"Will they not produce corn, and wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?"
"Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs, how else would you feed the beasts?"
"But what would you have, Glaucon?"
"Will not tutors be also in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are needed now?"
And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before?
"And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now, and not enough?"
"Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, they exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth?"
Shall we not?
Why?
he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?
But is not war an art?
And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?
"But is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else?"
"How then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day, whether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?"
"And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, and skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?"
Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?
"Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?"
Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding and watching?
What do you mean?
"Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?"
"And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or any other animal?"
Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?
And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?
"But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and with everybody else?"
What is to be done then?
"I said; how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?"
What do you mean?
And where do you find them?
Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?
"Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?"
What trait?
Did this never strike you as curious?
Why?
And must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance?
"And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?"
"And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge?"
Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength?
"Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them, how are they to be reared and educated?"
Is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end How do justice and injustice grow up in States?
And what shall be their education?
Can we find a better than the traditional sort?
"Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?"
"And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?"
And literature may be either true or false?
"And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the false?"
"And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?"
Of what tales are you speaking?
"But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with them?"
But when is this fault committed?
"Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but what are the stories which you mean?"
"There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him?"
"Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?"
And is he not truly good?
and must he not be represented as such?
And no good thing is hurtful?
And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
And that which hurts not does no evil?
And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
And the good is advantageous?
And therefore the cause of well-being?
"It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but of the good only?"
And what do you think of a second principle?
"Shall I ask you whether God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape, and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image?"
"Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?"
And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence?
"Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both, is least liable to suffer change from without?"
But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?
Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes?
But may he not change and transform himself?
"And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the worse and more unsightly?"
"Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man, desire to make himself worse?"
"But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?"
"Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?"
"Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be allowed, is hated of gods and men?"
What do you mean?
Am I not right?
"The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?"
But can any of these reasons apply to God?
"Can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?"
Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?
Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?
But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?
Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?
Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?
"But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death?"
Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?
"And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?"
And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men?
But shall we be right in getting rid of them?
And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible?
In the next place our youth must be temperate?
"Are not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?"
"What of this line,   O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag, and of the words which follow?"
"Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?"
And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there?
"And then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than   When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups, is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words?"
Or the verse   The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?
"What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another   Without the knowledge of their parents; or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?"
And what shall we say about men?
Why not?
"You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?"
"And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two?"
And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?
"But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, is going to speak?"
"And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?"
Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation?
Do I take you with me?
"In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art, whether the poets, in narrating their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation be prohibited?"
"You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our State?"
"Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any?"
And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one?
"Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations?"
Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?
"Did you never observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?"
"Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the offices of slaves?"
"Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?"
"How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?"
"Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of thing?"
And which are these two sorts?
Do you agree?
"These, then, are the two kinds of style?"
"And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if hc speaks correctly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great), and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?"
"And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words?"
"And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only of the two unmixed styles?"
or would you include the mixed?
"But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man plays one part only?"
"And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?"
"At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words, the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may presuppose?"
"And as for the words, there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same laws, and these have been already determined by us?"
And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?
"We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow?"
And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow?
And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?
"Well, and are these of any military use?"
"Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale?"
"Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed curiously-harmonised instruments?"
But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players?
Would you admit them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?
And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?
And everything else on the style?
"Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity, I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly?"
"And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?"
"But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State?"
"Or is the same control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him?"
"And when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form, and the two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it?"
And the fairest is also the loveliest?
And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?
But let me ask you another question: Has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance?
How can that be?
Or any affinity to virtue in general?
Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?
And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?
Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious?
Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?
Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort?
"Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty?"
What do you say?
"But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not?"
And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?
Why not?
"Do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from their customary regimen?"
How so?
What do you mean?
"Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements of Sicilian cookery?"
"Nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a Corinthian girl as his fair friend?"
"Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of Athenian confectionery?"
"And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education?"
"Is it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?"
"Would you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long litigant, passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant, but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness; he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to take every crooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole, bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice: and all for what?"
Is not that still more disgraceful?
"Well, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound has to be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill themselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh, compelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for diseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?"
How was that?
How do you mean?
"Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation?"
"Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue?"
"Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or can he live without it?"
"And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a further question, whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides?"
"All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question to you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad?"
and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?
But do you know whom I think good?
Will you tell me?
How so?
What then is the real object of them?
How can that be?
"Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?"
In what way shown?
And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?
And both should be in harmony?
And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?
And what happens?
"if he do nothing else, and holds no con-a verse with the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?"
"Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests?"
"Very good, I said; then what is the next question?"
Must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects?
"Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?"
"And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not be those who have most the character of guardians?"
"And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a special care of the State?"
And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?
"And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?"
How cast off?
"Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good, and willingly of evil?"
"Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess the truth a good?"
and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth?
"And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or force, or enchantment?"
Now you understand me?
"And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner influence of fear?"
That will be the way?
"How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?"
What sort of lie?
Such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it?
What is the difference?
"To keep watchdogs, who, from want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit, or evil habit or other, would turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but wolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?"
"And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?"
And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?
"For all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our State be ordered, and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters?"
"if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the city in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it; whereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses, and have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?"
"You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?"
What may that be?
What are they?
How do they act?
"The process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think you, any longer take the same pains with his art?"
He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?
"Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate?"
What evils?
How so?
"And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen who were not boxers?"
"What, not, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up?"
"And supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn more than one stout personage?"
Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number?
"And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore come and help us in war, of and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather th than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?"
Why so?
"And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?"
What limit would you propose?
What may that be?
"Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music?"
Is that true?
What do you mean?
You would agree with me?
Does not like always attract like?
"Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and may be the reverse of good?"
"Well, and about the business of the agora, dealings and the ordinary dealings between man and man, or again about agreements with the commencement with artisans; about insult and injury, of the commencement of actions, and the appointment of juries, what would you say?"
shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars?
"You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?"
For are there not ill-ordered States in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman do not these States resemble the persons whom I was describing?
"But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption?"
What do you mean?
"When a man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?"
"Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?"
"What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of legislation?"
Which are they?
"But where, amid all this, is justice?"
"Nonsense, did you not promise to search yourself, saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?"
"And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is not found will be the residue?"
"And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are also four in number?"
What is that?
The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel?
"And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?"
And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?
There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?
Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements?
"Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?"
Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would give the city the name of agricultural?
"Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently founded State among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best deal with itself and with other States?"
"And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found?"
And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge?
And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths?
Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?
How do you mean?
Salvation of what?
Shall I give you an illustration?
Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?
"Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?"
How so?
"Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a designation?"
"It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?"
"And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?"
"And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects?"
Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?
Why so?
Why so?
What do you mean?
Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?
And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?
Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law?
"And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?"
Which is a just principle?
"Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him?"
"Suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?"
"Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?"
And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed by you injustice?
"I proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called by the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same?"
"The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like the just State?"
And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the State severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes?
"And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same manner?"
"Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy question whether the soul has these three principles or not?"
May we not be satisfied with that?
"Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the same principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the individual they pass into the State?"
How else can they come there?
How can we?
"For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part?"
"Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in the fact of their opposition)?"
You would say would you not?
"that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires; or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when a person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the realisation of his desires, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent, as if he had been asked a question?"
And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection?
"Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?"
"The object of one is food, and of the other drink?"
"And here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the desire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink; or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired will be excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be small: but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple, which is the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?"
"Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?"
And the much greater to the much less?
"And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be?"
"And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives; is not this true of all of them?"
And does not the same principle hold in the sciences?
Because it has a particular quality which no other has?
And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?
"And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink; but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?"
"Then the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?"
"And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?"
And in such a case what is one to say?
"Would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him?"
"And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?"
"Then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from one another; the one with which man reasons, we may call the rational principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions?"
"And what of passion, or spirit?"
"Is it a third, or akin to one of the preceding?"
"And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a man's desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of his reason; but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed, is a sort of thing which thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?"
What point?
"Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?"
"Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?"
And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the State is just?
We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class?
"We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?"
"And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally?"
"And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?"
"And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the whole life of man?"
"Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his commands and counsels?"
And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?
"And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole?"
"And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?"
"And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or is she the same which we found her to be in the State?"
What sort of instances do you mean?
"If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?"
Would any one deny this?
"Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or treachery either to his friends or to his country?"
Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?
"No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?"
"And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?"
"Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?"
"Then our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been verified?"
"And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of use?"
"Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood?"
"May we say so, then?"
"Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal, what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?"
"And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will also be perfectly clear?"
What do you mean?
How so?
"And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?"
And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order?
"And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order?"
"Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?"
"And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?"
"Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods and men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and unreformed?"
"We know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life is still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be such as we have described?"
What do you mean?
How many?
What are they?
What are they?
"I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me to succeed one another, when Pole marchus, who was sitting a little way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear, of which I only caught the words, 'Shall we let him off, or what shall we do?"
"Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?"
"I repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off?"
"And was I not right, Adeimantus?"
"For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said Thrasymachus, to look for gold, or to hear discourse?"
But never mind about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way: What sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians?
"and how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?"
Then why should you mind?
What do you mean?
"What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs?"
"or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them?"
"But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are bred and fed in the same way?"
"Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the same nurture and education?"
"Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war, which they must practise like the men?"
"First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest, let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or not at all?"
And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?
Why not?
And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?
"Then we shall be asked Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?"
"But if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?"
"What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?"
And must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that Arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?
We acknowledged did we not?
And now what are we saying?
Why do you say so?
"Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do with us and our argument?"
In what way?
"I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?"
"Yes, I said, a jest; and why?"
Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?
"Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a man?"
"Let us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question: when you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty; a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas the other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he forgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to him?-would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?"
And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?
"Need I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd?"
Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?
"One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and another has no music in her nature?"
"Very true, and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?"
"Certainly, and one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy; one has spirit, and another is without spirit?"
Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort?
And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character?
And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?
"We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and secondly whether they were the most beneficial?"
And the possibility has been acknowledged?
The very great benefit has next to be established?
You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the same?
What is it?
"Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better than another?"
"And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?"
"You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens?"
And will not their wives be the best women?
And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?
"And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such manner as we have described, will accomplish?"
Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the State?
"And so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other necessity is not too strong a word, I think?"
"Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?"
And how can marriages be made most beneficial?
"Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?"
In what particulars?
"Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not some better than others?"
"And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to breed from the best only?"
"And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?"
"And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate?"
And the same of horses and animals in general?
"Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any particular skill?"
"That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?"
How so?
"Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim will be to preserve the average of population?"
We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?
And what is the prime of life?
"May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?"
Which years do you mean to include?
"But how will they know who are fathers and daughters, and so on?"
"And now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity, and also that nothing can be better would you not?"
"Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a State, what is the greatest I good, and what is the greatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil?"
Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign?
or any greater good than the bond of unity?
And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow?
Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens?
And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the same thing?
"Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him?"
Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?
All of whom will call one another citizens?
But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other States?
And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers?
And what do the rulers call the people?
And what do they call them in other States?
And what do the rulers call one another in other States?
And what in ours?
Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend?
"And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?"
But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?
"Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?"
"For example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of God or of man?"
Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?
"These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them?"
"And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?"
"And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain?"
"And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children?"
"And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?"
Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the State?
Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another?
How so?
"Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all things-to whom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the whole?"
"And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors is the life of shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with it?"
"You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of life such as we have described common education, common children; and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are able, women are to share with the men?"
"The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be found possible as among other animals, so also among men and if possible, in what way possible?"
How?
"Did you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys look on and help, long before they touch the wheel?"
And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians will be?
"True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?"
"Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?"
"Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but to know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and what dangerous?"
And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones?
And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?
"Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good deal of chance about them?"
What do you mean?
"Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies?"
What do you think?
"But the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him?"
What do you say?
And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?
What is your proposal?
"That the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as possible?"
"Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in the first place, that he is of the golden race?"
"Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they are dead   They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men?"
"We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he bids?"
"Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies?"
What about this?
In what respect do you mean?
"First of all, in regard to slavery?"
"Do you think it right that Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they can help?"
"Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?"
"Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything but their armour?"
Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?
"And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him, is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?"
Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?
"Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself?"
"Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of houses, what is to be the practice?"
"May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?"
Shall I tell you why?
"And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange to the barbarians?"
"And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?"
Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?
"And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own land, and share in the common temples?"
"And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord only a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?"
Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?
"They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?"
And for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses; their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction?
"But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside: Is such an order of things possible, and how, if at all?"
"True, he replied; but what of that?"
"I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?"
"Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed?"
"Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?"
And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?
What admissions?
I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language?
"Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?"
What do you say?
I am sure that I should be contented will not you?
What is it?
"Socrates, what do you mean?"
"Is not this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth?"
And what do you say of lovers of wine?
Do you not see them doing the same?
"Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire the whole class or a part only?"
"And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part of wisdom only, but of the whole?"
"And he who dislikes learnings, especially in youth, when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one?"
"Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher?"
Am I not right?
"Now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of quite minor arts, are philosophers?"
He said: Who then are the true philosophers?
"That is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?"
What is the proposition?
"That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?"
"And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?"
"And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the same remark holds: taken singly, each of them one; but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?"
How do you distinguish them?
"And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?"
"Reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?"
"But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer, or is he awake?"
"But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him, without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?"
"Shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?"
But we should like to ask him a question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing?
Something that is or is not?
Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
"And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?"
"But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being?"
"And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge, if there be such?"
Do we admit the existence of opinion?
"As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?"
Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties?
What division?
Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?
Would that be your way of speaking?
And will you be so very good as to answer one more question?
"Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?"
And is opinion also a faculty?
And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?
"Why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs?"
Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or subject-matters?
"Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to know the nature of being?"
And opinion is to have an opinion?
And do we know what we opine?
or is the subject-matter of opinion the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
"Then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be the subject-matter of opinion?"
"Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion?"
"or, rather, how can there be an opinion at all about not-being?"
"Reflect: when a man has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something?"
Can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing?
He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?
"And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?"
"Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of being, knowledge?"
Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?
And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?
"But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?"
"Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge, but lighter than ignorance?"
And also to be within and between them?
Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?
"But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?"
And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion?
"This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold he, I say, your lover of beautiful sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the just is one, or that anything is one to him I would appeal, saying, Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not also be unholy?"
And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?
"Doubles, that is, of one thing, and halves of another?"
"And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?"
And can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this?
Then what will you do with them?
Can they have a better place than between being and not-being?
Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being and pure not-being?
"Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see the many just, and not absolute justice, and the like, such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge?"
"But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only?"
"The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those of opinion?"
"Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them?"
And what is the next question?
"Inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our State?"
And how can we rightly answer that question?
"Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?"
"And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?"
"And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?"
What do you mean?
"And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another quality which they should also possess?"
What quality?
And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?
How can there be?
Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?
"The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth?"
What is that?
"Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence, think much of human life?"
Or can such an one account death fearful?
Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?
"Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or mean, or a boaster, or a coward-can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard in his dealings?"
What point?
"And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns, will he not be an empty vessel?"
"Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation?"
Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?
"And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion?"
And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?
"Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is to have a full and perfect participation of being?"
"And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn, noble, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?"
"Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?"
"Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them?"
"Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded?"
"Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?"
And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?
"Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other?"
"Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at variance with present notions of him?"
And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature?
Will he not utterly hate a lie?
"And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads?"
"Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will follow after?"
What are these corruptions?
What causes?
And how am I to do so?
"And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad?"
"Do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?"
"Do you really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of?"
Are not the public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists?
"And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?"
When is this accomplished?
"When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort, and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame at such a time will not a young man's heart, as they say, leap within him?"
Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?
or will he be carried away by the stream?
"Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he be?"
What is that?
"Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?"
What are you going to say?
"By heaven, would not such an one be a rare educator?"
Did you ever hear any of them which were not?
You recognise the truth of what I have been saying?
"Then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?"
Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?
And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world?
And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?
"Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end?"
"Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones?"
And his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets older for their own purposes?
"And what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and a tall proper youth?"
"Will he not be full of boundless aspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride?"
"Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?"
"And even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his companionship?"
"Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?"
And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?
"Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from philosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called goods of life?"
"Yes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the puny creatures who, seeing this land open to them a land well stocked with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts?"
Is not this unavoidable?
"Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new coat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's daughter, who is left poor and desolate?"
What will be the issue of such marriages?
Will they not be vile and bastard?
And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated?
"Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?"
The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has been shown-is there anything more which you wish to say?
"we are the founders and inventors, or some other?"
What is there remaining?
In what manner?
But what ought to be their course?
"But a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image, they have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them do you think that they ever did?"
Am I not right?
But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?
"Who can be at enmity with one who loves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy?"
"And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them, who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation?"
Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?
"And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself, but human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that which he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful artificer of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?"
"And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?"
"Will they disbelieve us, when we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern?"
But how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking?
"Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution?"
"And one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, they have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways of God?"
"And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard?"
"Why, where can they still find any ground for objection?"
Will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?
"Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the highest good?"
"But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?"
Or will they prefer those whom we have rejected?
"Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers bear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will this our imaginary State ever be realised?"
"Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle, and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other reason, cannot refuse to come to terms?"
"Will any one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers?"
And when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape who will venture to affirm this?
"The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?"
"And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?"
"And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but more remains to be discussed; how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies?"
What do you mean?
And will they be a class which is rarely found?
But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?
"You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom?"
And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them?
To what do you refer?
"What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this higher than justice and the other virtues?"
A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge?
Do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good?
The knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
"You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge   Yes and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?"
Certainly and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?
"Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things, of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be in the darkness of ignorance?"
And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be perfectly ordered?
"Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?"
"And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best of them blind?"
You would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road?
"And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when others will tell you of brightness and beauty?"
What?
And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?
"And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense?"
But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?
Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard?
"No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an addition?"
But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen?
How do you mean?
Of what nature are you speaking?
"Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light is their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?"
"And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element?"
Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?
May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?
How?
Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?
Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?
And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?
Will you be a little more explicit?
"Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no clearness of vision in them?"
"But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines, they see clearly and there is sight in them?"
"And the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no intelligence?"
"What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?"
"God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another point of view?"
In what point of view?
"You would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth, though he himself is not generation?"
May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?
"And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?"
"Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?"
In what manner?
"You are aware that students of geometry, arithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and everybody are supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with them, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their conclusion?"
"And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on the forms which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind?"
"And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall?"
"Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?"
"True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?"
And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?
"And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?"
"And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?"
"At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, -what will be his reply?"
"And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them, -will he not be perplexed?"
Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?
"And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?"
"True, he now  And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent, and held fast until he 's forced into the presence of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated?"
"And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day?"
"He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold?"
"And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change, and pity them?"
"And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, do you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or envy the possessors of them?"
"Would he not say with Homer,  Better to be the poor servant of a poor master, and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after their manner?"
"Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness?"
"And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous?"
"And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?"
"And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away from the truth?"
What do you mean?
But is not this unjust?
"he said; ought we to give them a worse life, when they might have a better?"
"And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light?"
Do you know of any other?
And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?
Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians?
"Surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics?"
"And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced, and how they are to be brought from darkness to light, as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?"
"The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?"
And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change?
What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being?
Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?
What quality?
"There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?"
"There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption?"
Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?
"But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme?"
"But what branch of knowledge is there, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us?"
"Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are also excluded, what remains?"
What may that be?
What is that?
"The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three in a word, number and calculation: do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them?"
Then the art of war partakes of them?
"Did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant of number?"
"And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?"
Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?
I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?
What is your notion?
Will you explain your meaning?
Then what is your meaning?
What is it?
"In these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question, what is a finger?"
But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?
Can sight adequately perceive them?
and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity?
"And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?"
And so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?
"Is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?"
And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft?
"What, again, is the meaning of light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, light?"
"And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?"
"And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?"
And to which class do unity and number belong?
"And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?"
"Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all number?"
And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?
And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?
How do you mean?
"Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, indivisible, what would they answer?"
"Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth?"
"And next, shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?"
You mean geometry?
"Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming only, it does not concern us?"
How so?
"They have in view practice only, and are always speaking?"
Then must not a further admission be made?
What admission?
Of what kind?
Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study?
And suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say?
What was the mistake?
First you began with a geometry of plane surfaces?
"And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?"
And what then would you say?
What do you mean?
"Still, I should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?"
And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?
Will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner?
But can you tell me of any other suitable study?
But where are the two?
And what may that be?
"The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these are sister sciences as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with them?"
What is that?
What do you mean?
I said; the prelude or what?
Do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn?
For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?
But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them?
Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
"Say, then, what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our final rest?"
"For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?"
But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider?
"Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness?"
"And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing?"
"And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?"
Will you admit so much?
"Yes, he said; how can I deny it?"
And you would say the same of the conception of the good?
"And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having no reason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?"
Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions?
"Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go?"
"But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?"
"You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?"
And what are these?
What do you mean?
"And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary falsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?"
"And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard?"
In what respect?
Why not?
"Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given them?"
At what age?
Why great caution?
"Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced?"
What evil?
Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case?
or will you make allowance for them?
In what way make allowance?
"Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?"
Or shall I guess for you?
But how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy?
"Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him, and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before?"
"And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore, and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires?"
And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?
"And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, any chance aspirant or intruder?"
"Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that be enough?"
Would you say six or four years?
And how long is this stage of their lives to last?
"that what has been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?"
How will they proceed?
"BOOK VIII  Socrates - GLAUCON   And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?"
"Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we agreed?"
"I do not know, do you?"
"Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other?"
"For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?"
"Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of individual minds will also be five?"
"Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness, of taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and begin with the government of honour?"
"In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another?"
"Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us 'how discord first arose'?"
"Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?"
How would they address us?
"Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak falsely?"
And what do the Muses say next?
And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy?
"Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will they proceed?"
"Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into being, and what is he like?"
In what respects?
Who was that?
And how does the son come into being?
"Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second type of character?"
And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?
Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises?
How?
The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do they or their wives care about the law?
"Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?"
"First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though he were a better pilot?"
You mean that they would shipwreck?
Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?
Except a city?
Would you include a city?
"This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?"
What defect?
Does that look well?
What evil?
"But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money, was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of citizenship?"
"Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body, although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a spendthrift?"
"May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive?"
"Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?"
"And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force?"
"The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education, ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?"
Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?
How?
"Is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara and chain and scimitar?"
"And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?"
"First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth?"
Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?
"Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life?"
Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries?
Where must I look?
"Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers to the oligarchical State?"
"Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?"
Is it not on this wise?
"The good at which such a State alms is to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?"
What then?
"The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?"
"And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?"
"The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:  What other?"
"And often rulers and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a pilgrimage or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye, and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them?"
And when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for much'?
"And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have they?"
"In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes?"
"And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases?"
Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human natures?
Why?
And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?
"Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or cares?"
Is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits?
"And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called unnecessary?"
"Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?"
"Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?"
We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
"And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary?"
"Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a general notion of them?"
"Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments, in so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the necessary class?"
The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life?
But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health?
"And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?"
"May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money because they conduce to production?"
"And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?"
"And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires, whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical?"
What is the process?
"When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing, in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical?"
"And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him, that which is and alike again helping that which is akin and alike?"
"Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise?"
"And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy I mean, after a sort?"
How?
The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am I not right?
And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?
"And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution?"
What good?
How so?
"Now, in such a State, can liberty have any limit?"
How do you mean?
"Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?"
But what is the next step?
"And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?"
"That, however, was not, as I believe, your question-you rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy, and is the ruin of both?"
How so?
What is that?
And do they not share?
Do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?
And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?
What else can they do?
"And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?"
How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant?
What tale?
Did you never hear it?
"And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills and others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny?"
"Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf that is, a tyrant?"
"This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?"
"Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?"
And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?
"And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?"
But will he not desire to get them on the spot?
How do you mean?
Why so?
And when these fail?
"You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, will maintain him and his companions?"
"But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be supported by the son?"
"Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence?"
beat his father if he opposes him?
"Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny?"
"Last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to ask, how is he formed out of the democratical?"
"and how does he live, in happiness or in misery?"
What question?
Which appetites do you mean?
"He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?"
After this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?
And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?
"Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?"
"And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the gods?"
"And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes drunken, lustful, passionate?"
"O my friend, is not that so?"
"And next, how does he live?"
"When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them, and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them, is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property, in order that he may gratify them?"
"And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?"
Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
"Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love of a harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father, first and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?"
Have we not here a picture of his way of life?
What sort of mischief?
And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?
"Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?"
"And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the most miserable?"
"and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in general?"
"And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the others?"
"And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation to man?"
"Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?"
"And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request, that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature?"
"May I suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations, where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men?"
Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person?
"Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?"
What do you mean?
"Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?"
"And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a State?"
"Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule prevail?"
"And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman, or of a slave?"
And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily?
"And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?"
And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?
And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?
And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?
Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain?
"And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?"
"Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State to be the most miserable of States?"
"And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?"
What do you mean?
Then who is more miserable?
Who is that?
What is your illustration?
You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants?
What should they fear?
But do you observe the reason of this?
"But imagine one of these owners, the master say of some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves?"
"And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?"
"And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of fears and lusts?"
"And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own person the tyrannical man, I mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when, instead of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant?"
Is not his case utterly miserable?
and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?
"He has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions, and distractions, even as the State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance holds?"
"Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston (the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest, and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his State?"
"And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?"
What is that?
Of what nature?
How do you mean?
"Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame?"
Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable?
"'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul?"
"One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in others, as may happen?"
"Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?"
"And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?"
"Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver?"
And the lover of honour what will be his opinion?
"Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?"
"And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure?"
"Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?"
"Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable, or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly?"
"Well, but what ought to be the criterion?"
Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?
"Of the three individuals, which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated?"
"Has the lover of gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain?"
"Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for he has a double experience?"
"Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?"
"His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?"
And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?
"Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?"
What faculty?
And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?
"If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?"
"Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?"
"And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?"
Last comes the lover of gain?
"Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls?"
"Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?"
"Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?"
And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?
"A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean?"
You remember what people say when they are sick?
What do they say?
have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?
"And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure?"
"Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be painful?"
Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain?
But can that which is neither become both?
"And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?"
"But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion, and in a mean between them?"
"How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?"
"This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is tc say, the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful, and painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations, when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of imposition?"
"What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?"
And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature?
Shall I give you an illustration of them?
"You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?"
"And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?"
"To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?"
"But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?"
All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions?
"which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder, I say, at this?"
"Look at the matter thus: Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions of the bodily state?"
And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?
And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?
And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer?
"What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue?"
"Put the question in this way: Which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?"
And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence?
And of truth in the same degree?
"And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?"
"Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul?"
And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?
"What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?"
"And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure?"
Their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise?
And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul?
"Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense?"
"Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour, when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him?"
"And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable?"
"But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?"
"And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?"
And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order?
"And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?"
And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?
"Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure, and the king at the least?"
"But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most pleasantly?"
Would you know the measure of the interval which separates them?
Will you tell me?
How do you mean?
"I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?"
"And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch?"
And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal and aristocratical?
Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three?
"Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue?"
"Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just?"
What shall we say to him?
Of what sort?
"'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble?"
He can hardly avoid saying yes can he now?
"But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question: 'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?"
"Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he received?"
And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable?
"Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?"
And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?
"And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this same creature, and make a coward of him?"
"And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money, of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a monkey?"
"From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness?"
"What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?"
"And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?"
"In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?"
"And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite harm?"
"And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?"
"I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth?"
To what do you refer?
What do you mean?
Can you tell me what imitation is?
Why not?
Will you enquire yourself?
Do you understand me?
"Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them, are there not?"
"And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use, in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how could he?"
Who is he?
"you are incredulous, are you?"
"Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?"
Do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself?
What way?
"And the painter too is, as I conceive, just such another a creator of appearances, is he not?"
And yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?
And what of the maker of the bed?
"Were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?"
Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?
"Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by God, as I think that we may say for no one else can be the maker?"
There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
And the work of the painter is a third?
"Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?"
Why is that?
"Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?"
And what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed?
But would you call the painter a creator and maker?
"Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?"
"Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator?"
"And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?"
And what about the painter?
"I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?"
As they are or as they appear?
What do you mean?
"Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear of appearance or of reality?"
"Perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth, because they are appearances only and not realities?"
"Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?"
"Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making branch?"
"Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?"
"'Friend Homer,' then we say to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue, and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life, tell us what State was ever better governed by your help?"
"The good order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good?"
Is there any city which he might name?
"Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?"
"Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?"
"But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or teacher of any?"
"Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him?"
"For surely, Socrates, Creophylus, the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as is said, Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive?"
"But can you imagine, Glaucon, that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine, I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and loved by them?"
"And is it conceivable that the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous?"
"Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?"
"Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?"
"Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like, but the truth they never reach?"
"They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?"
Am I not right?
"Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?"
And the worker in leather and brass will make them?
But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?
And may we not say the same of all things?
What?
"That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?"
"Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?"
"The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is told by him?"
"The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?"
But will the imitator have either?
Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?
Or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw?
Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?
The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations?
"And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?"
"Imitation is only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic or in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?"
"And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?"
And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?
What do you mean?
"I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small when seen at a distance?"
"And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding-there is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?"
"And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction?"
But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?
Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?
And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation?
And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?
"And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?"
Is there anything more?
"But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life?"
"Though I need hardly raise the question again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?"
What was the omission?
"Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more equanimity than another?"
"But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?"
"Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?"
When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?
"There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow?"
"But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in him?"
One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?
How do you mean?
What is most required?
"Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason?"
"And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call irrational, useless, and cowardly?"
And does not the latter I mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation?
"Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the principle in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is easily imitated?"
"But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation: the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?"
Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?
What point of view?
"If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the poets;-the better nature in each of us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another's; and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too?"
And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous?
"I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?"
"Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre?"
"And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers I mean, if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight?"
"And what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?"
"What, are there any greater still?"
"Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time?"
The whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity?
And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole?
But why do you ask?
"Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable?"
"He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you really prepared to maintain this?"
There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?
"Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?"
"And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and disease?"
"And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and at last wholly dissolves and dies?"
"If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction?"
"Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?"
But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?
Is not this true?
Does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her?
"Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?"
"And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?"
"Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny?"
"And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?"
"But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that injustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but in quite another way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds?"
"But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be immortal?"
What do you mean?
"The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?"
Where then?
"Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?"
What did I borrow?
Do you remember?
"And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?"
"And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins?"
"Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of virtue?"
And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?
"Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?"
And what do they receive of men?
"But will you let me assume, without reciting them, that these things are true?"

"Sometimes they accumulate and put by, eat and give not; if for instance the rain were to fail or a deluge were to distress the world, they, trusting in their own power, would not care for the misery of dervishes, would not fear God and would say:  If another perishes for want of food  I have some; what cares a duck for the deluge?"
The base when they have saved their own blankets  Say: What boots it if all mankind perishes?
What information or knowledge does the silly beast posses  Whether it is carrying a load of wood or of books?
How knowest thou that he will not some time become thy foe?
"It has been said that as the friendship of friends is unreliable, what trust can be put in the flattery of enemies?"
"Those who sell the religion for the world 'are asses', they sell Joseph but what do 'they buy'?"
"Did I not command you, O sons of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan?"
"A sage observed: 'O ignorant man, what sayest thou?"
What strength has one brought up in the shade  To go against champions in a fight?
Knowest thou not that the Hejazi musical tune  Succumbs to the roar of the drum of war?
What can he see in a dark mirror?
How can he who lives in comfort and abundance  Know what the state of the famished is?
Hast thou heard that Alexander went into the darkness  And after all his efforts could not taste the water of  immortality?
What needest thou to show enmity to him  Who has such a foe on the nape of his neck?
If at the resurrection he addresses us in anger  What chance of pardon will even prophets have?
"How can he hear whose organ of audition has been created dull, and how can he avoid progressing upon whom the noose of happiness has been flung?"
To whom shall I complain of thee?
"What can an old prostitute do but vow to become chaste, and an policeman not to commit oppression upon men?"
"Though I was still such a poor monk in the  Way, since I was now devoted to letting myself drift like a cloud and float like a  reed, on what mountain or by what river could they seek me out?"
Is this not creating  vast spiritual merits?
What is to be gained from that?
But what about those who are already clear as to what the Buddha’s  True Teaching is?
"It is just that they cannot be taken hold of and defiled,’  and ‘The one who clearly sees what the Way is, is the one who practices the Way.’  Understand that you must do your training and practice amidst the realizing of the  Way.”   He may then ask, “What about those Japanese teachers of earlier generations  who spread Scriptural teachings throughout our country?"
"To pass one’s life just sitting around idly, what can be gained  by that?"
"For you to now equate the wondrous Dharma of all the Buddhas  with the mistaken notion that your mind will abide whilst your physical features  perish, and to imagine that the very thing which gives rise to the cause of birth and  death has freed you from birth and death—is this not being foolish?"
So why  do you risk contradicting the correct principle by saying that the body ceases whilst  the mind permanently abides?
"So, how does  the mind, on its own, apart from the body, keep from arising and disappearing as  this body of yours arises and perishes?"
"So, within this one all-inclusive Dharma, how can you separate body from  mind or split ‘birth and death’ off from ‘nirvana’?"
Who amongst those in the worlds of either the mundane or the saintly could     Shobogenzo: On Doing One s Utmost in Practicing the Way of the Buddhas        possibly be excluded from entering?
"Shobogenzo: On the Great Wisdom That Is Beyond Discriminatory Thought     This Indra Lord of the Heavens then addressed the Buddha,  saying, “World-honored One, if virtuous men and women were to  receive this teaching on Your purported ‘Wisdom That is Beyond  Discriminatory Thought’, hold to it, and recite it to others chapter and  verse, were they to explore its implications and then lecture upon it to  others, what could they possibly do to defend it from critical attack?"
“And why so?
“And how so?
"     Shobogenzo: On ‘The One Bright Pearl ’        Shibi responded, “I have never dared to deceive anyone about   that!”   Delighted by this response, Seppo said, “Who could fail to  cherish this response?"
"Or who will  say, once he has fully investigated the matter, that the universe is merely a  motionless thing?"
"Just turn your light around and return to That which  shines within, for how much use is there in trying to understand This through the  intellect?"
Do we not cherish the Bright Pearl with Its infinite variety of shades and  hues like this?
"Its multifaceted, brilliantly hued sparkling is the merit of the  universe throughout all its ten quarters; who can take this from you by force?"
"Hence, the conscious mind is not what we are, so who is it that arises and passes  away?"
Why worry yourself over whether or not something is the Bright Pearl?
"Alas, the impermanent cannot be relied on, for who knows on what blade of  roadside grass our dew-like life will fall?"
"Were the matter like  this, there would be no way, upon examination, to distinguish right  from wrong, so how can we accept it as correct?"
How can  this be considered the uttering of our Teachings?
"An ancient one of great virtue once said, “And just what is this wondrously  pure, bright mind?"
Who among the Buddhas and Ancestors of the past failed to  shave Their heads?
?
"How can we possibly not want to pay homage to the  Triple Treasure, nor to accept the respectful bows of others, nor to bow to them in  return?"
So how can it  possibly be fathomed by any human speculations?
"With the coming of night, I heard the eighty-four  thousand songs ,    But with the rising of the sun, how am I ever to offer  them to you?"
"What, moreover, do you  see when you view the contour of a mountain, or hear when you listen to the sound  of the valley stream?"
"Is it a single phrase you hear, or half a phrase, or the whole  eighty-four thousand songs?"
"‘His giving tongue to’ is never remiss, for how can the contours of His  Body be subject to a temporal existence and dissolution?"
"Nevertheless, when It  comes into sight, we leam how very near It has always been: when It is lying  unseen, how are we to learn how near It really is?"
Are Its sound and form the  whole of It or are they but half of It?
But was it the voice of the  stream or was it what had poured forth from his Master Joso’s lips?
"Who will say, upon discerning It, that It is  ‘a whole dipperful’, or who will say, upon flowing into It, that It is ‘a whole  oceanful’?"
"In short, was it layman Toba who awakened to the Way or was it the  landscape that awakened to the Way?"
What person is clear of eye and yet fails to  quickly spot His eloquent tongue and His immaculate body?
"Then, as though facing Isan  himself, he said, “O Great Monk Isan, if long ago you had said something to me     Shobogenzo: On ‘The Rippling of a Valley Stream... ’        for my sake, how would I now have had this experience?"
Is there anyone who has not entered by way of some external condition?
"Is  there anyone who, once having entered, would retreat from this Place, or lose It?"
"Were it not that the contour of the mountain is the  Pure Body of Buddha, how could a thing like this possibly happen?"
When will come the time that they abandon such things and realize the Way?
Why do I  say not to feel sorry for them or resent them?
"Unaware of the  springtime pine, blind to the autumnal chrysanthemums, what will he have as  fodder for his teaching?"
How will he help others to sever their karmic roots?
"On the other hand, should you not yet  possess the strength to proclaim valley stream and mountain as Valley Stream and  Mountain, who will be able to hear you give forth the valley stream’s True Voice or  see you take the mountain’s True Form?"
"Poor, pitiful Rakuten, why did you say  such a thing?"
"If someone does not  yet know all the Buddhas of the three temporal worlds, how will he be able to  understand a three-year-old?"
"Even though a male  monk be one of greater age and longer residence, if he has not realized what  Dharma is, why would you want him instead?"
"Among people of all stations, even  the foolish and befuddled are sensitive to sincerity, so why would the genuine    Eno said to them, “Might a member of the laity be permitted to call a quick end to this lofty  debate?"
"Frankly, it is not the wind or the banner that is moving, kind sirs, it is your minds  that are moving and nothing more.”     Shobogenzo: On ‘Respectful Bowing Will Secure the Very Marrow of the Way ’     Teachings of all the Buddhas not respond compassionately to sincerity?"
Why should only males be worthy of respect?
"These spiritual merits will always accompany them, and who among  ordinary people of any social station could possibly equal the spiritual merits of  these four stages?"
"So,  who would possibly fail to revere a Tathagata who passes on to us the True  Teaching, or a bodhisattva who has given rise to the greatest of intentions?"
"And worse still, how many of  these male monks have grown old playing the role of slave to these women?"
"In the name of that enlightenment which is unsurpassed, why have  they passed over reverencing someone—be it male or female—who has truly  realized that Teaching which is to be revered?"
"Should  you detest women because you think that they must be objects in the world of  sensual desire, would you also detest all men?"
Shouldn’t these all be things to be given up?
Are they not things  that should all be ignored?
"And also, in T’ang China there have been foolish and befuddled monks who,  having given rise to the intention to commit themselves to the Way, have said, “I  will never look at a woman in this or any future lifetime, no matter how long such  a life may be.”  On what teaching is this vow founded?"
Is it founded on the rules  of society?
Or on the Buddha’s Dharma?
Or on the teachings of some non-  Buddhist?
Or on the doctrines of some distracting demon from the world of sensual  desire?
What fault is there in being female?
What virtue in being male?
"Further, should you vow never to look at a woman, ought you to forsake  women even at the moment when you take the Bodhisattva Vow to save all sentient  beings from suffering, howsoever innumerable they may be?"
"Were you to forsake  women, you would not be a bodhisattva, so how could you speak of Buddhist  kindliness and compassion?"
"If you despise women in any  such ways, you must despise every single person, so how will you make manifest  the Buddha’s Dharma?"
"If the matter were like this vow, did the Venerable Shakyamuni and the  bodhisattvas who were alive during His lifetime all commit offenses?"
Have Their  enlightened minds been shallower than yours?
Just what is  ‘an incarnation of a Buddha or a Bodhisattva’?
Is it a worldly-wise person or a  saintly one?
A god or a hungry ghost?
One who is ten times saintly or one who is  thrice wise?
"One who has realized what supreme enlightenment is or one who has  realized the wondrous, full enlightenment of a Buddha?"
"Shobogenzo: On ‘Respectful Bowing Will Secure the Very Marrow of the Way’     to alter anything from the past, are we not to abandon our drifting through the  realms of birth and death?"
Is there a single person today who  surpasses Him?
"So, what Buddhist community is without female  monastics, or lay women, or lay men, or the eight categories?"
"Within the three worlds of desire, form, and beyond form, as well as in any of the  Buddha lands throughout the ten directions of the universe, what world may they  not reach?"
Who can ever possibly prevent anyone from doing his or her daily  training in the Way?
"Since women are already acting as Buddhas, which of all the Teachings may they  not thoroughly master?"
 Who could presume to hamper them or prevent them  from realizing the goal?
"They already have spiritual merits that are said to illumine  the whole universe in all ten directions, so who can put limits on them?"
"Shobogenzo: On ‘Respectful Bowing Will Secure the Very Marrow of the Way’     And also, would you hamper a celestial female who is in one of the heavens  of the world of desire so as to prevent her from realizing the goal, or do the same to  a daughter of some deity?"
Who is the one who would block these celestial women from the way of heaven or  the way of the gods?
"If you make a distinction between a place where a Buddha is and what a  Buddhist community is, how will you accept either one in faith as a place of the  Buddha Dharma?"
"Were we to discuss the  understanding of the Way of a field hand, say, and a female monk, or the spiritual  level they have realized, what quality would we ultimately come to ascribe to  each?"
"In a realm where defiling acts are cultivated, is it simply a matter  of despising those who do not cultivate them?"
From whom did they receive Transmission: from whom did they  receive the seal of Buddha Mind?
Who among  them will not call this ‘securing the very Marrow of the Way’?
?
"Even if we comprehend that It is what persists, who can express in words  what This is that we have realized?"
"Yakusan asked him, “The one standing before you has a fairly  good idea of what all twelve divisions of the Scriptures as found  among the followers of the Three Vehicles of Buddhism are about,  so just why did the Ancestral Teacher Bodhidharma come east to  China??"
"Although the venerable Masters up to the present time have spoken about  the Matter in such a way, might there not be something more that needs to be  said?"
"Even  if such a gem were to serve as the imperial seal at an enthronement, how could it  possibly compare with the wondrous treasure that Transmits Buddhahood?"
"Had they received no help from the good that they  did in previous lives, how could they possibly have received that body of theirs  which made possible their actually looking upon, and reverently bowing to, the  Buddha’s robe that Buddha after Buddha had directly passed on?"
Why  can the four lines of the verse or a single line of Scripture produce such a profound  spiritual experience of being ‘with It’ here and now?
What other tradition has genuinely Transmitted the robe and the Dharma of  our Venerable Shakyamuni as we have genuinely Transmitted Them?
"Who, upon encountering this robe and Dharma, would  fail to be generous in respecting Them and in making venerative offerings to  Them?"
"Since even animals repay kindliness,  how could humans fail to understand kindness?"
"How much  less could they come up with anything that clarifies for others what its materials,  colors, and measurements are?"
"If it is something other than the  Dharma clothing of previous Buddhas, what are we to clothe ourselves with so that  we may train in and practice the Buddha’s Way and attend upon all the Buddhas?"
"How, then, could such persons ever  possibly accept and keep to one?"
"If you today were to use a  small-sized robe like theirs, how could the everyday behavior of a Buddha ever  continue for long?"
And why is this so?
Are we not to collect waste bits of silk?
What reason could there possibly be for  feeling that we should be prejudiced in regard to silk or cotton?
"To look down on  silk thread because it was produced through the killing of a living being is vastly  laughable, for is not cotton cloth the product of a living thing?"
"If your view of  something being either sentient or non-sentient is not yet free of any commonplace,  sentimental feelings, how will you possibly understand what the kesa of a Buddha  is?"
" What, pray, is  not a transformation of something?"
Where are your ears and eyes at this very moment?
Or have they become part of some stream of celestial beings?
"A certain monk once asked the Sixth Ancestor, “Is the robe  passed on to you on Mount Obai in the middle of the night one made  of cotton, or one made of silk, or one made of taffeta?"
How could they possibly recognize the kesa of  a Buddha?
"Truly, how could the thousands of shifts and the myriad  variations in the way that a Buddha says things possibly be in the realm where  commonplace thinking flows?"
"Although there were those outside the  Ancestral Path who used the word ‘kesa’, none of the original Ancestors ever  affirmed them as their offshoots, so how could they possibly germinate the seeds  that produce the roots of virtue, much less the fruits of it?"
"How could I not regret the days and years I had  so wastefully spent, or not grieve their passing?"
Why would they  not wear one?
"It is said that everyone—from Lord Brahma and those in the six  worlds below him, down to male and female prostitutes and those in forced  servitude—can receive the Buddhist Precepts and don the kesa, so are there male  and female monks who would not wear one?"
"It is said that even animals can take  the Buddha’s Precepts and put on a kesa, so why would a disciple of the Buddha  not don the Buddha robe?"
"At the  time of Her giving birth to the Child, are Parent and Child made separate?"
"But how could there possibly be the slightest  gap between Ummon’s and Eno’s Skin and Flesh, Bones and Marrow, or between  Ummon and his living within his own realization through training?"
Who taught them this?
"When frozen solid, It is harder than a diamond, so who can  smash It?"
"When melted, It is more yielding than diluted milk, so who can tear It to  bits?"
Are there really  ‘all sorts of ways’ of seeing any single object?
Have you committed an error by  taking the plethora of images for what is actually one object?
"If mountains are  beyond comparison with the everyday notion of ‘flowing’, who then, pray, can  doubt that a mountain flows, and that a mountain does not flow, as well as  whatever else a mountain may do?"
 Was it not a fish  he hooked?
Was it not a person he hooked?
Was it not the Water he hooked?
Was it  not someone from the Water he hooked?
Who other than a Buddha could declare  this state to be the most honored or certify it to be unsurpassed?
"If the Way  of the Buddhas had not determined the succession of the Dharma, how could It  possibly have come down to us today?"
What is at the heart of this?
Why is our  Venerable Master Shakyamuni revered so deeply by others?
Why is Great Master Ummon revered so deeply by  others?
Who will rescue  them?
"Venerable elder brother, do you wish to be my Dharma  heir?"
"Moreover,  how could the Buddhas of the present Eon of the Wise and Virtuous have inherited  the Dharma from the Buddhas in the previous Eon of the Sublime?"
"If Shakyamuni Buddha had not inherited  the Dharma from Kasho Buddha, He would have been the same as some non-  Buddhist who denies cause and effect, so who then could have faith in Shakyamuni  Buddha?"
"Further, in this Scripture it speaks of three vehicles, but what is the     Shobogenzo: On ‘The Flowering of the Dharma... ’        distinction between the large ox-cart and the cart drawn by a white  ox ?"
"In  relation to what you have asked, the words of the Scripture clearly  state that ‘There are not two vehicles, nor are there three.’ How come  you have not realized this?"
"Because I was not yet clear as to the purpose of my  coming into this world,   How was I to halt the folly of my troubled life?"
"Who within the burning house know   That, from the first, they are lords within the Dharma?"
"When you consider entering the gate from the burning house while riding  upon this finely adorned cart, will it be because you are looking hopefully towards  the open fields beyond as the place you need to enter, or because you recognize the  burning house as the place you need to leave, or because you realize that the  threshold of the gate is merely a point to be passed through?"
Who will make into a conveyance the three mundane worlds through which they  spin and ride it as the One Vehicle?
"Who will go back and forth through their  opening up, manifesting, awakening, and entering as though such events were a  gate?"
Have you fully realized that the Divine  Vulture Peak rests serenely in the open fields?
Have you incorporated into your  training and practice that open fields are flat and level on the Divine Vulture Peak?
"In our wholehearted desire to meet Buddha, do we pursue through our  spiritual exploration and practice that Buddha is ourself, or do we pursue through  our spiritual exploration and practice that Buddha is some other?"
"It is our not seeing Buddha, though Such is near; so  who, pray, lacks the faith to wholeheartedly grasp That Which Is Beyond Our  Grasp?"
"So, should we consider that our present characteristics and innate nature are  practicing within the realm of the Dharma or within dust particles?"
"How much, pray, does this wholehearted waiting serve  as a gauge of the Buddha’s wise discernment?"
"The old woman replied, “Reverend monk, what use would you  have for buying them?”   Tokusan said, “I want to buy them to refresh my mind.”   The old woman then remarked, “Reverend monk, that load  you’re carrying with you is really something!”     Shobogenzo: On ‘The Mind Cannot be Held Onto oral version        Tokusan replied, “Have you not heard of me?"
"What  I am carrying with me are my commentaries on the Diamond-Cutting  Scripture .”   Upon hearing him say this, the old woman asked, “Reverend  monk, would you permit an old woman like me to put a question to  you?”   Tokusan replied, “You now have my permission to ask  whatever you may wish.”   The old woman said, “I once heard the part in the Diamond-  Cutting Scripture where it says, ‘The mind of the past cannot be held  onto; the mind of the present cannot be held onto; the mind of the  future cannot be held onto.’ Which mind do you think you will refresh  with these rice cakes?"
To merely see the blowing out of a paper candle ?
"The old woman replied, “I am an old woman who sells rice  cakes.”   Tokusan asked her, “Will you sell me some rice cakes?”   The old woman said, “Reverend monk, why would you want to  buy them?”   Tokusan replied, “I would buy your rice cakes so that I might  refresh my mind.”   The old woman remarked, “Reverend monk, that load you’re  carrying with you is really something!”   Tokusan replied, “Have you not heard of me?"
"Shobogenzo: On ‘The Mind Cannot be Held Onto written version        I am carrying with me are my commentaries on the Diamond-Cutting  Scripture .”   Upon hearing him say this, the old woman asked, “Reverend  monk, would you permit an old woman like me to put a question to  you?”   Tokusan replied, “Yes, ask whatever you may wish.”   She said, “I once heard the part in the Diamond-Cutting  Scripture where it says, ‘The mind of the past cannot be held onto; the  mind of the present cannot be held onto; the mind of the future cannot  be held onto.’ Which mind do you think you are going to refresh with  these rice cakes?"
How does that hit the mark?
"When Tokusan was unable to speak, why didn’t the old woman  question him further?"
"He was a wild fox cub who was idly playing around with the  Western River and Tientsin Bridge, with boat races and monkeys, so how could he  possibly have seen the National Teacher?"
"Speaking in general, how could a worldly scholar of the Tripitaka possibly  match the everyday practice of the Buddhas and Ancestors, or recognize the  whereabouts of the National Teacher?"
"How could what pedestrian teachers or arrogant  scholars know possibly match the powers of wise discernment of bodhisattvas  about to realize Buddhahood, or even of those ‘thrice wise and ten times saintly’?"
Shobogenzo: On ‘The Mind Cannot be Held Onto written version        he having such difficulty seeing it?
"As to being in conformance with the Buddha Dharma, the National  Teacher’s saying, “In what place is this old monk now?” is asking, in effect, “Is It  here?"
Or is It there?
Is It unsurpassed enlightenment?
Or is It the wisdom that  ferries others to the Other Shore?
Is It dependent on unbounded space?
Or is It  standing on solid ground?
Is It the hermit’s grass hut?
"The ten times saintly and thrice wise are not up to it, and it is beyond both  those who are about to become Buddhas and those who have just awakened, so  how could an ordinary Tripitaka Master possibly recognize it ?"
"Shobogenzo: On ‘The Mind Cannot be Held Onto written version        recognize the Body and Mind of the National Teacher, then can those of the two  Lesser Courses also recognize it?"
And why is that?
"Joshu said, “He did not see where the National Teacher was because he was  right on the tip of the Tripitaka Master’s nose.” What does this remark mean?"
How could the National Teacher possibly be right on the tip of the  Tripitaka Master’s nose?
What is it that  he is calling ‘just too close’?
What does he understand as being ‘just too close’?
"Kaie Shutan said, “If the National Teacher was right on the tip of the  Tripitaka Master’s nose, why was he having such difficulty seeing it?"
"So,  even though the National Teacher was on the tip of the Tripitaka Master’s nose and  within his very eyeballs, how would Shutan know it?"
"Had he been rebuked for  this, who would have any confidence in the National Teacher?"
"Since what he said is so, how could the Great Round Mirror have been born  at the same time as Kayashata?"
"Was the poem what the  Round Mirror voiced, or was the poem what the child spoke?"
"Was the Great Round Mirror born at the same time as  the child, or was the child bom at the same time as the Great Round Mirror?"
What does it mean  that the Mind of one is like the Mind of another?
 What does it mean that the Eye of one is like the  Eye of another?
"From the first not a single thing exists,      So from where is dust or dirt to arise?"
"What is more, can there possibly be a single dust mote  anywhere in the universe that is not in the Mirror?"
Can there possibly be a single  dust mote on the Mirror that is not of the Mirror?
"Right now, from among all the faces, which is your own True Face?"
"If the twelve two-hour periods of a day were not mirrors,  how could they possibly illumine the past?"
"If the twelve periods were not mirrors,  how could they possibly illumine the present?"
Is the principle that is now being expressed saying that the  foreigner who comes is the foreigner who appears?
How much weight should we give to the  term ‘clear’ that he is using at present?
"So, are the ‘clear’ of the Clear Mirror and the  ‘ancient’ of the Ancient Mirror the same, or are they different?"
Does the Clear  Mirror have the nature of being ancient or not?
Does the Ancient Mirror have the  nature of being clear or not?
"In the words of Shibi’s disciple, Ancestral Master Kinkazan  Koto, “The Ancient Mirror is polished.” Might it also be so for the Clear Mirror?"
What is the meaning of this principle of ‘both disappearing’?
"Since the  foreigner’s and the Han’s having already come and appeared does not get in the  way of the Ancient Mirror, why should they both disappear now?"
"Were there not full and sweet accord between ‘parent’ and  ‘child’, how could the coming forth of the reverend monk’s question and the  request for the reverend monk to ask the question in turn take the form they did?"
"Despite this, do you describe the hundreds of shattered pieces  that we are speaking of now as the Ancient Mirror or do you describe them as the  Clear Mirror?"
"Even though Shibi was able to bring forth the question about the Ancient  Mirror and the Clear Mirror, when we discuss his way of putting the Matter,  might it be that the words which come to the tip of our tongue to describe that  which manifests before our very eyes simply as ‘walls and fences with their stones  and tiles’  probably was, for him, ‘hundreds of shattered pieces’?"
Shobogenzo: On The Ancient Mirror        And what form do the shatterings take?
"The red-faced apes that Seppo  saw, of what sort would they have been?"
But is the back  of the Ancient Mirror backed by red-faced apes?
"So, which is it, red-faced ape or Ancient Mirror?"
"Ultimately, how should we  put it?"
Are we just red-faced apes?
Are we not red-faced apes?
To whom are we to  put the question?
"Enen replied, “For eons beyond measure, It has been nameless,  so why are you expressing It as ‘the Ancient Mirror’?"
And what do I call the Ancient Mirror?
"Enen responded, “What has such deadly urgency?"
"Although Its width of ten feet is at one with the width of  the world being ten feet, does It necessarily stand shoulder-to-shoulder in form and  likeness with the limitlessness of the world?"
"Or are the Ancient Mirror and the  world’s limitlessness like fellow trainees, side by side?"
"In looking at the charcoal burner now, from what perspective do we view it?"
"Shobogenzo: On The Ancient Mirror        unbounded space, or to the whole of the great earth, or to the clear and bright life  stream of the Buddhas and Ancestors?” And you need to be diligent in your  exploration of just how many heels could be involved: is it just one heel, or half a  heel, or hundreds of thousands of myriad heels?"
"In his phrase ‘not yet touched the ground’, what sort of thing is this ‘ground’  he is talking about?"
"So, what sort of thing is this ‘ground’ that one should touch one’s heel  down upon?"
Is this ‘ground’ our real being?
Or is it beyond our real being?
"Further,  in sum, can even the tiniest bit of that which we call ‘the ground’ not exist within  the Great Way?"
"Is the heel touching the ground the way it should  be, or is the heel not touching the ground the way it should be?"
"Since “Why?” is  the question, why did Shibi state that not even a heel had touched the ground?"
"If great saintly teachers did  not have the Dharma of polishing a tile, how could they possibly have the skillful  means to guide people?"
"Who can  surmise that in this act of making, there is the making of a Buddha and there is the  making of a Mirror?"
"Who can recognize that there is a Mirror in which, when a tile comes,  the Tile appears?"
"And who can recognize that there is a Mirror in which, when a  mirror comes, the Mirror appears?"
"Yakusan’s question has a double meaning: “What makes you doubt that your Abbot is doing  his job?” and “Why do you doubt that Buddha Nature (The Old Monk) has Its teachers, just  as the Scriptures and the commentaries have theirs?"
"Because I was not yet clear as to the purpose of my  coming into this world,   How was I to halt the folly of my troubled life?"
"Who within the burning house know   That, from the first, they are lords within the Dharma?"
"But did the old woman have the Eye to see that, or  was she not yet equipped with that Eye?"
"Still, in his reading and reciting the whole of the Tripitaka,  did he use a whole Eye or only half of It?"
Did what our Founding Ancestor said  and what my late Master said involve the use of their Eye or the use of their  tongue?
And to what extent did they come to use them?
"djb    Meditation Master Yafu Dosen once said in verse:   You may well ask, “Boundless are the merits of offerings made  to the countless Buddhas,   But how can they possibly resemble the merits from continually  reading Their ancient instructions  Whose words are written in ink upon white paper?"
"What people  call ‘ancient instructions’ are the inked words written on white paper, but who can  understand these as Their Age-old Instruction?"
"Shobogenzo: On Buddha Nature        cutting the roots of the defiling passions that they are afflicted with, for when does  their ever-busy consciousness come to rest?"
Who has ever said that there is anything within Buddha Nature to perceive  or comprehend?
"And as to His saying “When the right moment arrives,” the moment has  already arrived, so where is there room for doubt?"
"Even so, he did  not receive It from his father or from his grandfather, nor was It like his mother’s  clan name, so how can It possibly be equated with the name of some third party?"
"To clarify the Fourth Ancestor’s remark, “You do not have Buddha Nature,”  he is saying, in effect, “You are not It, and even though you put your trust in It, you  do not possess Buddha Nature.” You must comprehend this and explore it through  your training, for when is it that someone does not have Buddha Nature?"
Does  someone lack Buddha Nature upon starting out towards Buddhahood?
Does  someone lack Buddha Nature upon having gone beyond realizing Buddhahood?
"I wonder, did the  Sixth Ancestor comprehend this or not?"
"So, how could Their ‘having It’ in ‘having It through and through’ fail to be Their  inheriting of the Dharma that is expressed as ‘not possessing It’, in which there is  no lacking It?"
"Foolish  people fancy that the Venerable One provisionally displayed his body in some  altered form, which is described as ‘the look of a full moon’, but this is an arbitrary  and false notion of those who have not had the Buddha’s Way Transmitted to them  from Master to disciple, for where or when would It possibly manifest as  something separate from and independent of one’s body?"
"By being cloaked in It, his meditative  state, which is free of attachments, takes on a form resembling the Moon at Its full,  for the meaning of ‘Buddha Nature’ is That which is utterly unbounded and  radiant.”   Now, among those skin bags, past or present, who have heard the Buddha  Dharma as It has spread through the heavens above, the world of humans, and the  great thousandfold worlds that comprise the universe, which of them has said that  the look of someone manifesting his or her Spiritual Body is what Buddha Nature  is?"
"Where is the Buddha, or the pair  of Buddhas, whose display of It did not take on the physical presence of a  Buddha ?"
"How many teachers of Scriptures, as  well as erudite scholars of Their commentaries and the like, have tripped over what  the Buddhas and Ancestors have said?"
"On the other hand, if you do not portray the  manifestation of the Spiritual Body, or portray the Full Moon, or portray the Moon  at Its full, or aim at portraying the physical presence of all Buddhas, or embody the  displaying of this presence, or aim at manifesting the Dharma, you will be vainly  drawing a picture of a rice cake, and what does that get you?"
"If you are quick to set  your sights straight, who of you will not be sated right here and now, and not go  hungry?"
Is what they call  ‘paying heed to the Scriptural Teachings’ the Way of the Buddha?
Or is what they  call ‘practicing Zen meditation’ the Way of the Buddha?
"Were Isan and Hyakujo able to hear me at this moment, I would now say  to Hyakujo, “Granted that both are slanderous, are you able to state what Buddha  Nature is?"
"As to this ‘within all the hours of a day’ of his, would you ask at what  specific time It will show up or in what country?"
"These twenty-four hours that we  are speaking of, would they have to be a human being’s twenty-four hour day?"
Or  do they exist as a day in some other particular place?
Or are they the kind of day  that can occur for a while in Samantabhadra’s Silver Realm?
"Nansen said, “Setting aside for the moment the matter of payment for your  rice broth, to whom are you to return payment for your straw sandals?” In other  words, the cost of your rice gruel is put aside for the moment, but who gets paid for  the cost of your straw sandals?"
Why was he so concerned about the cost of straw sandals?
Is clearly seeing Buddha  Nature the same as opening the Eye?
Is one’s Buddha Nature seeing clearly the  same as losing one’s Eye?
How  about that point?
"Karmic ignorance has never understood what a dog really is, so how could a dog  possibly encounter Buddha Nature?"
Is That Which Always Exists strongly impelled to enter into fleshly form or  is It not?
"  Moreover, as Sekito Kisen put it in a poem:   If you would know the Undying One within the hermit’s hut,   How can you do it apart from your fleshly body here and now?"
"Even though we may not yet know who the Undying One is, when, pray, are we to  separate It from our fleshly body?"
"I wonder, in which part does the Buddha Nature reside?”   The Master responded, “Do not engage in deluded, dualistic  thinking.”   The official asked, “But how do you account for the  twitching?”   The Master replied, “It is simply that the elements of wind and  fire have not yet dissipated.”   Now, when the government official remarked about an earthworm being cut  in two, had he concluded that, prior to its being cut, it was one segment of Buddha  Nature?"
"As to the ‘two parts’ in his saying that both parts continue to move, did he take the  worm before it had been cut to be one part of Buddha Nature, and did he take That  which goes beyond awakening to be one part of the worm?"
"Is it that the two cut segments made up one whole and,  moreover, that they exist as a whole being?"
"He should have said, “When someone cuts Buddha  Nature in two, I wonder in which part does the earthworm reside?” In saying,  “Both parts continue to move, so in which part does Buddha Nature reside?” does  he mean that, if both are moving, it is not possible for Buddha Nature to reside in  either?"
"Or is he saying that, if both are moving, the place where Buddha Nature is  residing must be in one or the other, even though both are moving?"
"When the Master responded, “Do not engage in deluded, dualistic thinking,”  what could he have meant by saying that his disciple should not engage in dualistic  thinking?"
"Did he mean that there is nothing dualistic about both parts moving, that  the matter is beyond duality?"
Or did he simply mean that Buddha Nature is beyond  duality?
"As to the official’s asking what we are to make of their twitching, is he  asserting that because they are twitching, it must be due to their piling one Buddha  Nature atop another, or is he asserting that even though they are twitching, it is  apart from their Buddha Nature?"
Is he  saying that it is Buddha Nature or is he saying that it is wind and fire?
What is the underlying meaning of ‘not yet having dissipated’?
"In  his saying that they have not yet dissipated, is he saying that although the wind and  fire had arrived, the time for their dispersal had not yet arrived?"
"   When It is stated on an even loftier level, what could It possibly be, this  Buddha Nature?"
"Have you really grasped It yet, in detail?"

"On the other  hand, to view and explain enlightenment as ‘just being enlightenment’ may well be  a perspective that accords with enlightenment, for who could call this a false view?"
"Even though the explanation by the  former Buddha of Mount Sokei is beyond ‘me’, how could it possibly not refer to  ‘you’?"
"Who of us can see as mistaken these persistent dreams and  illusions, these manufactured ‘flowers in the sky’?"
"How much less could they possibly experience and perceive that  beyond birth from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation there is birth from  Womb, Egg, Moisture, or Transformation?"
"How are we to categorize that bunch who most likely have not heard of this  expression, much less have they learned about it, or understood it, or clarified what  it means?"
"You have already heard about the four types of birth, but how many  types of death are there?"
"For the four types of birth, could there be four types of  death?"
Or could there be only two or three types of death?
"Or could there be five or  six types, or a thousand or myriad types of death?"
Can there be any kind of sentient being  sprung from one of the four types of birth who experiences birth but does not  experience death?
"And are there any to whom the direct, one-to-one, Transmission  of death has been given who have not received the direct, one-to-one, Transmission  of life?"
"Should any of you be in the dark about the times when this ‘birth-  and-death’ occurs, who could say who your ‘you’ really is?"
Who would describe  you as someone who fully understands what life is and who has mastered what  death is?
" If it  were as they say, would all the places where a Buddha was present have to be part  of the human world?"
"So, how could they possibly fathom the everyday behavior of a Buddha doing His  practice?"
"How could the useless, ‘grain by grain’ calculations of common, worldly people  possibly yield the measure of It?"
And what is death?
And  what is body and mind?
And what is given and what is taken?
And what is  ‘keeping true to’ or ‘violating’?
Is it going in and out of the same gate without  meeting ‘such a one’?
Or is it our concealing our body while letting just our horns  show ?
 Or is it placing just one piece at a time on a Go game board and letting it  lie there?
Is it giving great consideration to the Matter until we resolve It?
Or is it  letting our thoughts mature until we realize It?
Is It the One Bright Pearl?
Or is It  what the whole of the great Treasure House teaches?
Is It the staff that supports an  elderly monk?
Or is It one’s Face and Eye?
Is It what comes after thirty years of  training?
Or is It ten thousand years within a single thought?
Is it a single iron rod?
Is it  both parts moving ?
"To paraphrase, is the everyday behavior of a Buddha doing His practice like a single iron  rod, which is the same at any time or place?"
Or is His everyday behavior like a worm that  has been cut in two?
"When They are present within the Blazing Fire,  are the Blazing Fire and the Buddhas intimately connected?"
Or are the Two turning  away from each other?
Or are They one and the same both within and without ?
  Do They have a within and a without?
Are Their within and without the same  thing?
Are Their within and without equally distant from each other?
Is there any difference between  speaking of turning the Wheel of the Dharma and actually turning the Great Wheel  of the Dharma?
"Setting the Wheel of the Dharma in motion is beyond any voicing  of the Dharma, so will the voicing of the Dharma necessarily exist for the sake of  others?"
"And even though all  the Buddhas in the three temporal worlds listen to It right on the spot where They  are, how could the Wheel of the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the three temporal  worlds possibly have set into motion the Blazing Fire?"
Does the Blazing Fire  which voices the Dharma for the sake of all Buddhas in the three temporal worlds  also turn the Great Wheel of the Dharma or not?
"Would what he said simply be a case of his having thought that ‘Persians  have red beards’ when, in fact, it was the case that ‘a Persian’s beard is red’ ?"
"In other words, when it comes  down to Their listening to the voicing of the Dharma by the Blazing Fire right  where They are, what is it that ultimately manifests before Their very eyes?"
"Be that as it may,  is Shibi’s Blazing Fire the Buddhas or is he taking all the Buddhas to be the  Blazing Fire?"
Why reject ‘this’ merely to adopt ‘that’?
"Even though you are in a place where you may hear what Engo  called ‘Buddha giving voice to the Truth’, still, how deeply entangled are you in  your failure to recognize ‘the Tmth giving voice to Buddha’?"
And why so?
How could the Buddhas and Ancestors who have directly Transmitted one-  to-one the Buddha’s Treasure House of the Eye of the True Teaching have failed to  directly Transmit one-to-one what the Buddha taught?
Shobogenzo: On What the Buddha Taught        the everyday functioning of those in our Buddhist family?
"Our Venerable  Shakyamuni has already endowed us with the Teachings that are directly  Transmitted, so why would any Ancestor of the Buddha do away with Them?"
"If the  matter were as such folks put it, are we to describe the Teaching as ‘a separate  Transmission outside the Mind’?"
So how much less could they possibly  comprehend that the sum total of the eighty-four thousand gates to the Dharma is  nothing other than the intent behind the Ancestral Master’s coming from the West?
" If there were a time when they  were essential, what criteria would we use to determine this?"
"In a situation where  the Three Vehicles and the twelve divisions of the Scriptural Teachings are not  essential, does our exploration of ‘the intent behind the Ancestral Master’s coming  from the West’ manifest itself in our training?"
"At this very moment, how is It?"
How could those who have not opened their Eye to This possibly be  descendants of the Buddhas and Ancestors?
How could those who have not  understood It and come forth with It possibly Transmit one-to-one the True Eye of  the Buddhas and Ancestors?
" Because ten thousand kalpas and one instant, alike, have  been spewed out from a hair and a poppy seed, from whence have the hair and the  poppy seed been obtained?"
"The ever-changing  characteristics of the marvelous spiritual ability of Buddhas have no connection  with something short or something long, so, in all seriousness, how can one  possibly undertake to evaluate Them simply by making comparisons?"
How could the holy man possibly  have known that the Buddha had six spiritual abilities?
"Even though the holy man said that he saw just six abilities, it  was beyond him to attain even six spiritual abilities, so how much less could he  allow for other spiritual abilities, even in his dreams?"
"Shobogenzo: On the Marvelous Spiritual Abilities        Shakyamuni, could he truly say that he had ‘seen Buddha ’?"
" Even though he might  say that he had ‘seen Buddha’, could he truly say that he had met the Venerable  Shakyamuni?"
"Even though one can encounter the Venerable Shakyamuni, even  though one may say that he has ‘seen Buddha’, we need to ask, has such a person  encountered ‘the Holy One with five spiritual abilities’ yet?"
 How could saying that the Buddha has six marvelous spiritual  abilities possibly reach even the level of counting the riches of one’s neighbor?
"Even though He gave expression to the natural functioning of that one spiritual  ability, how could the holy man have possibly penetrated what that one spiritual  ability is?"
"Even though the abilities of the holy man were seen through by the Buddha’s use  of His spiritual abilities, how could the holy man’s abilities possibly see through to  the spiritual abilities of a Buddha?"
"At the heart of what the Venerable Shakyamuni was saying is, “Of what use  is your asking about the sixth spiritual ability?"
Right?
"Surely this was not being saintly, was it?"
"Apart from the legitimate  descendants in our Buddha family, who would even hear that this principle exists?"
How could that bunch who are  bent on counting grains of sand—those folks who are aimlessly wandering about in     Shobogenzo: On the Marvelous Spiritual Abilities        delusion—possibly realize the fruits of these stages?
"Who could possibly doubt that, in arriving There, a drop of water  swallows and spews forth a vast ocean, and a speck of dust picks up, and lets go of,  a lofty mountain?"
"Even though, in seeking for someone who is not enlightened, it is hard to find even  one, did you ever encounter a person who was half-enlightened, and whose  countenance and genial demeanor were impressive in their openness?"
Is such a one difficult to find?
Is such a one not  difficult to find?
"Let us focus for the moment on the following questions: When one who has  experienced the great enlightenment reverts to delusion, will that person be exactly  the same as one who has not experienced the great realization?"
"At the time when  one who has experienced the great enlightenment reverts to delusion, does that  person take the great realization and make it into something delusory?"
Does the  person revert to delusion by taking some delusion from within someone or  someplace else and then use it to cover up his great realization?
"Also, does the  person who has experienced the great realization as a whole person, then destroy  his great realization when he reverts to delusion?"
"And also, does what is called ‘the     Shobogenzo: On the Great Realization        reversion to delusion of a person who has experienced the great realization’ treat  the holding onto an instance of great realization as being a reversion to delusion?"
"Further, is it the great  realization on the one hand and a reverting to delusion on the other hand?"
And why is that?
"The monk asked, “How can what anyone is thinking about be  based on not deliberately thinking about something ?”   Even though the condition of not thinking about anything in particular is of ancient  vintage, how can one possibly think about it?"
"How can thinking not go on while  sitting ever so still, and why did the monk not pierce through to what goes above  and beyond simply being ever so still?"
" Even though its being  ever so still is being ever so still, how can its being ever so still possibly think  about being ever so still?"
" It is even inferior to the paths  that the common and lofty people pursue, so how can we possibly speak of such  befuddled people as folks who are exploring the Buddha Dharma?"
What is a  ‘beginner’?
What person is not a beginner?
And where do such folks find a  beginner’s attitude of mind?
Does he have in mind that there is  something above and beyond sitting in meditation?
Or has there never been a  practice that can be considered as more special than sitting in meditation?
Or  should we not aim at anything at all?
"Or, is he asking Baso whether some goal has  manifested from his sitting in meditation at the present time?"
"When he  speaks of becoming a Buddha, what exactly does he mean?"
Is he asserting that  becoming a Buddha means being made into a Buddha by a Buddha?
Or is he  asserting that becoming a Buddha means making a Buddha into a Buddha?
Or is he  asserting that becoming a Buddha is the emergence of one or two aspects of a  Buddha?
"Is his aiming to become a Buddha the result of his having dropped off  body and mind, or is his aiming at becoming a Buddha itself the dropping off of his  body and mind?"
"Or is he asserting that aiming at becoming a Buddha is tangled up  with one’s aims, despite the fact that becoming a Buddha applies to all things?"
"To question a bit further, how  many instances of becoming a Buddha has this single wish entangled?"
"Seeing this, Baso asked him, “Reverend Master, what are  you doing that for?”   Truly, who would fail to see that he was polishing a tile?"
"If the cart is not moving, is prodding the cart the right thing to do or is  prodding the ox the right thing to do?”   Now then, as to his words “if the cart is not moving,” what does ‘the cart’s moving’  mean, and what does ‘the cart’s not moving’ mean?"
"For instance, is the water’s    o   flowing synonymous with the cart’s moving?"
Is the water’s not flowing  synonymous with the cart’s moving?
In Nangaku’s saying “Is prodding the cart the right thing to do or is prodding  the ox the right thing to do?” can there be both a prodding of the cart and a  prodding of the ox?
Will prodding the cart and prodding the ox be equivalent or  not?
"Is the ox we are prodding  a water buffalo, or is it the Iron Ox, or is it an ox coated with mud?"
"Will a riding  crop be our prod, or will the whole universe be our prod, or will one’s whole heart  and mind be our prod?"
"Should we beat it till the Marrow gushes forth, or hit it with  our Fist?"
How could anyone possibly  say that exploring ‘seated meditation’ is exploring ‘seated Buddha’ unless that  person were a child or grandchild of a genuine heir?
What need do we have to search for whether our spiritual bloodline is within  us or within someone else?
Why get into discussions about delusion and  enlightenment?
Who would want to take up the matter of ‘how to cut off defiling  passions by developing wise discernment’ merely as an intellectual pursuit?
"Who within the realm of non-abiding thoughts and things would choose not  to be a Buddha, and who, pray, chooses to be a Buddha?"
"Whoever does not illuminate  the myriad Teachings cannot be called clear and bright, and is not someone who  has gained the Way, so how could such a one be an Ancestor of the Buddha either  now or in the past?"
"So how could they possibly have  received the direct, one-to-one Transmission of the seated meditation of Buddha  after Buddha and Ancestor after Ancestor?"
Who can reckon what a thousand miles or ten thousand miles are?
What is your experience of That which is above and beyond  Buddhahood?
"Pray, what could be the underlying principle of these exchanges?"
And why do I say so?
"I would comment that it is not that there are no words in that place above and  beyond Buddhahood, it is just a matter of “I cannot say it.” Why does he not say it?"
"Because he did not know what this key point was, how could he possibly  distinguish between the false and the true?"
How could they possibly know the  key point of what is above and beyond Buddhahood?
"Since they are already ‘such a  person’, why would they be worried about experiencing That Which Is?"
And by  what means are we to know that That Which Is exists?
Where has the ruddy face of our  youth gone?
How do we know that we are ‘such  a person’?
"If this mental awareness did not exist, how could we possibly be conscious  of a ringing sound?"
Why do I  say this?
"Later in the text, Dogen will interpret it as, “The  matter is beyond the wind moving and beyond the banner moving: you are the Mind  moving.”     Shobogenzo: On That Which Comes Like This        dear sirs, Move.” Why do we say it in this way?"
"But how could he have  known of the ancient Teachings that illumine the Mind when someone is seated at  ease by the Bright Window, and from whom could he have learned about cleansing  and removing stains?"
"Having suddenly been illumined by hearing the  Scripture, he departed from his elderly mother and went searching for a good  spiritual friend—all of which is uncommon behavior among human beings, for  who can treat lightly the bonds of affection for one’s parents?"
 How  about you?
"A young man who lived in the area asked him, “You foolish,  decrepit old man, how can you be so dim-witted?"
Who could possibly think it would be an easy task to try to emulate his spiritual  wisdom?
Is a person ‘really living’ or ‘not really living’?
Is a person  ‘old’ or ‘not old’?
"If you do not single-  mindedly devote yourself to reaching the Other Shore, who will rescue you?"
"So how are those of us  who are in our prime, yet still spiritually unimpressive, to equal one who is so  deeply revered?"
"Rather, he composed a poem in reply:   Broken down yet living still, a withered tree aslant amidst  the chill forest,   How many times have I met the spring, my heart  unswerving?"
"Woodcutters pass this monk by, without even a backward  glance,   So why does the carpenter eagerly desire to seek me  out?"
"So, how can we possibly seek to  sate ourselves by fulfilling our every wish?"
"When even secular people  reside in thatched dwellings, how can those who have left home life behind to be  monks possibly aim at dwelling in lofty halls or elegant mansions?"
"How could those who have left home life  behind to be monks possibly be inferior to secular folk who moil about in their  delusions, or be as muddied by defiling passions as such folk?"
Why should we be  limited to measurements in yards and feet?
Is there  any skillful means by which we can have returned to us even one day that has  passed?
How does time rob us of our efforts?
What animosity is there between  time and us?
Shobogenzo: On Ceaseless Practice        Tokusan possibly be considered the equal of Rinzai?
The novice continued this verse with the following:   What can stem this valley torrent  From surging back to the Ocean Great?
"During the frosts and springs of his  three years in sailing the seas, how could the winds and snows have been the only  miseries?"
"What karmic conditions in any life are not like Shakyamuni’s  royal palace, and what royal palace may not serve as a spiritual training ground?"
Who could stand head-and-shoulders  with him?
"If the Ancestral Master had not come from the West, how could sentient  beings in the East have possibly learned of the Buddha’s True Teaching?"
"Now, meditation in its narrow sense is simply one among  various practices, so how could it suffice to say that this was all there  was to the Saintly One?"
"When Emperor Wu of Liang first met Bodhidharma, he asked  him, “What is the paramount Truth of the Holy Teachings?”   The Master replied, “Since the Truth is devoid of any limits, It  is beyond holiness.”   The emperor went on to ask, “And who, pray, is this one who is  confronting our royal presence?”   And the Master replied, “I do not personally know that One.”   If Bodhidharma had not been fluent in the local language, how  could the discussion have gone like this at that time?"
How  could anyone with a heart possibly take lightly their indebtedness to the Master for  his compassion?
How could anyone with a heart possibly fail to repay this  indebtedness?
"While we are cherishing lowly lives like these in a remote land such as this  one, we may chance to hear the True Teaching of the Tathagata; how then could we  possibly have the heart to cling to these lowly lives?"
"Were we to persist in clinging  to them, for what purpose, pray, would we attempt to drop them off at a later date?"
How could we possibly know the  customs by which one pays respect to the ruler of a large country?
"There were people who were still going to India after the P’u-t’ung era of  the Liang dynasty, and for what?"
"And what, pray, was  gained by their going off to India?"
"If we today who still revere the  profound principle of our First Ancestor’s coming from the West should,  nevertheless, be sparing of these stinking skin bags we call ourselves, what,  ultimately, would be the purpose of that?"
"For which  is it worthwhile to forsake life and limb: for some small-minded person or for the  broad, vast, deep, and far-reaching Buddha Dharma?"
"Had the Buddhas and Ancestors not directly  Transmitted the Dharma to us, how could It possibly have reached us in the  present?"
Shobogenzo: On Ceaseless Practice        will bow out of respect for it?
Who would buy or sell it as a relic?
"Shobogenzo: On Ceaseless Practice        Dharma and the dignity of his virtuous ways, a strange and wondrous being  suddenly appeared and said to him, “If you really desire to receive the fruits of  your endeavors, why do you tarry here?"
And  why so?
How could anyone with a human face be  oblivious to their great indebtedness to the Tathagata from encountering and  heeding His unsurpassed True Dharma?
"When we hear about what he did and imagine the  hardships he faced, how can those of us today who are heartfelt trainees possibly  fail to feel pity for him?"
"So, how can it possibly be all right for monks to  indulge in conventional ways of living by being neglectful and greedy?"
" If we stop our training  at this point, we will suffer from our cravings and greeds, but why do  we need to do so?"
"If we do not bring them to a halt right now, when will  we deal with them?"
"If we can exhaust them in each  moment of the present, what more is there to do?"
"Have you not heard of Inzan, who, to his dying day, did not wish  to meet with anyone?"
"Or of Joshu, who, to his dying day, did not wish  to speak with anyone?"
"If they did not  have such strong points, how could anyone have entrusted themselves  to them?"
"So how could it possibly be all right  for me to sit here, squandering our communal provisions and forgetting  about our connection with the former saintly ones?"
"Why should it be  necessary for any Master today, upon entering the Dharma Hall to give  Teaching or upon letting trainees enter his private chambers for  instruction, to imitate some Master of old by picking up the drum stick,  or holding his ceremonial hossu upright, or shouting towards the east,  or pointing his traveling staff to the west, or raising his eyebrows, or  looking with glaring eyes—and all this done in the manner of one who  is sick with rage?"
"Have you not realized that Bodhidharma came from the West  and, having arrived at the foot of a remote mountain, sat facing a wall  for nine years?"
"Further, in speaking of Bodhidharma, do we think he was unable to  teach anything for the sake of human beings?"
"In speaking of the Second  Ancestor, do we think that he was not seeking a Master?"
"And, my virtuous ones,  have you encountered the following poem by one of old?"
Just what is this “Do not return to your former home?” What are we to make  of it?
"Is one doing a ceaseless practice which recognizes that ‘returning home’ is  the same as not practicing the Way, or is one doing a ceaseless practice that is  beyond ‘returning home’?"
Why is returning home not practicing the Way?
Is one  hindered by not practicing or is one hindered by self?
"Why did  Nangaku put this expression in his poem, and why did Baso accept these words of  Dharma?"
"If you were to claim something like this, would it mean that the  Buddhas and Ancestors, who do not crave fame and gain, are therefore unable to  benefit sentient beings?"
"If each person is to come to his own  understanding of what the Buddha Dharma is about, why, pray, did  those in the past who probed into the Matter seek out a Master so that  they might ask the way to go?"
How can the Buddha Dharma possibly flourish in  their care?
 How  much the less could I squander my efforts on wandering off to the  mountains or playing about in lakes and streams?
"Otherwise, my old friends, where could the Buddha Dharma be found  and what would It be like?"
"Venerable Monk, why will you not accept it?"
"Now, when this mountain monk  ascended the Dharma Seat, what Dharma did he give expression to?"
Where else  could one possibly meet with such a person?”   Is there anyone who would not have accepted the ten thousand pieces of  silver?
And why so?
Just what is this ‘arising’?
"In the unceasing time of arising and vanishing, who is it that arises  and vanishes?"
"And They say that you are just the same, for who is  not a ‘you’?"
"And They say that ‘I’ is just the  same and, since previous moments and following moments all constitute what an  ‘I’ is, who is not an ‘I’?"
Who could say that this is our day-by-day conduct of ‘staying in the  water’?
" Since Its various elements will enter into  the composition of all of these, why must the Great Ocean always refer only to  deep waters?"
" In what exists, why is something that has ceased to breathe not  connected with It and how can It not give lodging to corpses?"
"So how could  the great earth with its mountains and rivers, along with Mount Sumeru and its vast  oceans, possibly be exceptions?"
Why would the prediction of Buddhahood not  include a single mote of dust?
Why would the prediction of Buddhahood not  include each thought and thing?
Why would the prediction of Buddhahood not  include all the myriad thoughts and things that arise?
Why would the prediction of  Buddhahood not include training and enlightenment?
Why would the prediction of  Buddhahood not include the Buddhas and the Ancestors?
Why would the  prediction of Buddhahood not include one’s doing one’s utmost in practicing the  Way?
Why would the prediction of Buddhahood not include great realization and  great delusion?
"Since this is so, how can the Buddhas and the Ancestors not include ‘all the things  that sprout up’?"
How can all the things that sprout up not include ‘me’ and ‘you’?
"Were it not for this Truth which Masters have given  through their Teaching,   From what perspective, pray, could we talk about It?"
"Shobogenzo: On Predicting Buddhahood        So, within this assembly of countless beings, even though the wishes and  levels of understanding of these countless heavenly beings and dragon kings, of  those in the four categories of Buddhists, and of those in the eight categories of  nonhumans may differ, who would have them hear one line or verse which would  not be the Wondrous Dharma?"
How could any of you take joy in non-Buddhist  teachings even for a moment?
"Shakyamuni Buddha, in addressing the Lord of Healing, also  said, “Further, after the Tathagata’s extinction, if there is someone  who hears a single verse or line of My Teaching, which is the  flowering of the Wondrous Dharma, and that one were to rejoice in It  even for a moment, I would predict supreme, fully perfected  enlightenment for such a one as well.”   What would be the time span implied by the phrase ‘after the Tathagata’s  extinction’ that was just spoken of?"
Would it be within the forty-nine years after  His enlightenment or would it be within the eighty years of His whole life span?
"When the Buddha said, “If  there is someone who hears a single verse or line of My Teaching, which is the  flowering of the Wondrous Dharma, and that one were to rejoice in It even for a  moment,” was he referring only to what is heard by those who are keen-witted and  not to what is heard by those who are dull-witted?"
And does it matter if they hear it  correctly or not?
In which lifetime are you able to receive His  prediction?
"Is it in the past, or in the present, or in the future?"
"Shobogenzo: On Predicting Buddhahood        Maitreya, will you receive the prediction in any lifetime?"
Will you do  it by being able to receive the prediction in life just as it is?
Or will  you do it by being able to receive the prediction in death just as it is?
And why is that?
And why is  that?
And why is that?
How do I know this to be true?
Can it be that the ‘someone’ who is ‘like someone who’ is just a word in a  simile?
"And further, is this ‘someone’ an ordinary, everyday person or might it be  someone who is no ordinary, everyday person?"
"If reaching behind with the hand is essential, then is there  something essential that needs to be reached with the eyes?"
Would it refer to the realm of hands and eyes?
Is it in  possession of human hands and eyes?
"Or is it just hands and eyes alone, flashing  like bolts of lightning?"
Is it one or two instances of hands and eyes being right  from head to tail?
But who is the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion?
"Although Dogo’s expression, “What did you get?” is another way of Ins  saying, “I’ve gotten It,” it is one which does not stand against Ungan’s “I get It.”  Even so, Dogo had his own way of putting “What did you get,” a way that means  “I’ve got It and you’ve got It.” Would this not be equivalent to “Our eyes get It and  our hands get It?” Is it referring to an understanding that has emerged or to an  understanding that has not yet emerged?"
"There  is Ummon’s statement, “There are the Kannons who, upon seeing the forms of  things, clarify Their minds, or who, upon hearing the sounds of things, awaken to  the Way.” What sights and sounds are not encompassed within Kanzeon  Bodhisattva’s seeing and hearing?"
"Shobogenzo: On Kannon, the Bodhisattva of Compassion        cp cp dfe   (X)   Translator’s Addendum from  Book , Koan  of Dogen’s Chinese Shinji Shobogenzo   Once while Mayoku Hotetsu was training in Rinzai’s community, he asked  Rinzai, “Which is the true Eye of the Compassionate One with a Thousand Hands  and Eyes?”   Rinzai replied, “Which is the true Eye of the Compassionate One with a  Thousand Hands and Eyes?"
Why would anyone stop at just listening to Buddhas and Their  disciples?
And why is this?
And why?
If  only I could go through the world in such a manner as to produce no  karmic wake—though I may not have the chance—would I not then  be an arhat who has left behind the defiling world?
"In short, were I to express the Matter, how would I word it?"
"On another occasion he composed a verse:   When I think about those throughout the country who  have left home life behind,   How many can there be whose state resembles my state  in life?"
"This is why, when the monk said, “Venerable Monk, pray, do  not use some physical object to point it out to a person like me,” Joshu replied, “I  am not pointing it out to you by using a physical object.” What venerable monk is  limited to being a ‘venerable monk’?"
"Because he is not so limited, he will be  Joshu’s T. And what  is limited to being that T?"
"And what physical object would not be   limited by Bodhidharma’s intention of coming from the West, since a physical      object must certainly have been what he intended by coming from the West?"
"It was a matter of one person—namely,  Joshu’s monk—who had still not been able to experience a mutual encounter with  his Master, so how much could he himself have actually realized?"
 Would this not  be his hearing what is false and his taking its ramifications in hand?
"And because It had been  brought forth from where It had been entombed, this was comparable to Joshu’s  saying to his disciple, “Come on, return my efforts!” And because he was saying,  in effect, “Come on, show me It!” he said, “I am not pointing it out to you by using  a physical object, so, come on, show It to me!” Well, what will the monk use to  point it out with?"
"Further, are the hundreds of thousands of cypress trees all of the same  species or are they of different bloodlines?"
"Can there be cypress trees that realize  Buddhahood, and cypress trees that are doing the training and practice, and cypress  trees that have awakened to the enlightened Mind?"
"Though a cypress tree may  have realized Buddhahood, will he not be equipped with such things as training  and practice or will he not have an awakening to the enlightened Mind?"
"And, pray,  what are the causes and coexisting conditions that connect a cypress tree and the  Empty Sky?"
"If a cypress tree’s becoming Buddha is indeed the time when “I am  awaiting Your coming down to earth,” is the merit of a cypress tree invariably  synonymous with the Empty Sky?"
"Let me put it to you, dear old Joshu, is it because  you too were a withered cypress tree that you could breathe such life into these  matters?"
"Now, as to a cypress tree having Buddha Nature, which Joshu expressed, is a  cypress tree limited by being called ‘a cypress tree’, and is Buddha Nature limited  by being called ‘Buddha Nature’?"
Who says that Buddha Nature must invariably realize Buddhahood?
" Since  these are the very places where the What exists, would that explain what light is  and what brightness is?"
Who could assert  that a luminous Buddha had never emerged on Mount Ummon?
"Now, I would like to ask Ummon, “What is it that you are calling ‘each and  every human being’?"
"But what did Ummon mean by referring to the Three Gates of the Monks’ Hall, the  Buddha Hall, and the Temple Kitchen?"
"After all, how many Three Gates of the  Monks’ Hall, Buddha Hall, and Temple Kitchen are there?"
Should we regard them  all as Ummon?
Or as the Seven Buddhas?
 Or as the twenty-eight Indian  Ancestors?
Or as the first six Chinese Ancestors?
Or as the Fist?
Or as the Nose?
Where was the brightness to  be found then?
"So, right at this very moment, what  sort of thing is appearing before our very eyes?"
"So, should we treat the great  earth with its mountains and rivers, the sun, the moon and the stars as being within  us or outside us, as arising or as departing?"
"When we are bom, is one speck of  something added to us?"
"At death, does one mote of something depart from us?"
"Where are we to find this birth-and-death, along with our views about it?"
 And who among  you will fix your eyes upon It and look ?
"As a consequence, how could Eka’s expressing his realization by  doing three prostrations before Bodhidharma and then standing silently in his place  possibly be equaled by that bunch who are stuck on ‘skin, flesh, bones and  marrow’?"
Shobogenzo: On Expressing What One Has Realized        through the trackless sky could one traverse in order to go beyond such terms as  ‘our whole life’ and ‘a monastery’?
"If you are not mute, how can you possibly meet  with a Mute, or converse with a Mute?"
"Given that That Person is as silent as a  mute, how are we to meet with Him or converse with Him?"
Who can know what     Shobogenzo: On Expressing What One Has Realized        kind of life went on within that hut?
"“If you can say what you have  realized, should I not shave your head?” can also be understood as “My not  shaving your head means that you have a way of expressing the Matter,” right?"
Had he come as  his way of expressing what he had realized or had he come as his way of not  expressing what he had realized?
"Now, what could Seppo’s remark, “If you can say what you have realized,  should I not shave your head” really mean?"
"Since they have not clarified  what this one saying is about, who could affirm that they had thoroughly explored  the sayings of other Buddhas?"
How do I know this?
"Had they not correctly Transmitted this  principle, how could anyone penetrate to what is fundamental in the Buddha’s  Way?"
" At that  very moment, who can say that this is not some limiting of the heavens and some  covering up of the earth?"
"Even with the ‘three and three before, or three and three after’ over time  immemorial, who among them is not a Moon?"
"If it were as these foolish people say,  how could it possibly be the Teaching of the Tathagata?"
"Who among you would fail, time and  again, to cast your line for boat and shore, and who among you would fail to  quickly cast an eye to clouds and moon?"
"  When the  flowers within Unbounded Space cannot be seen by such people, what can exist for  them?"
And who knows that this  ‘wrong’ is also what Truth is?
"Since they have still not understood what  ‘reliance on Unbounded Space’ means, how could they possibly understand what  ‘reliance on the earth’ means?"
"Do you produce your walls and fences by  building them up, or do your walls and fences bring forth their own building up?"
Are they deliberately built up or not?
"Do you treat them as something sentient, or  as something non-sentient?"
Do they manifest before your very eyes or not?
"Great Master Zengen Chuko was once asked by a monk, “Just  what is the mind of an old Buddha?”   The Master responded, “His mind’s world has caved in.”   The monk then asked, “Why has his mind’s world caved in?”  The Master replied, “Would you prefer that I put the Matter as  ‘he no longer has a self of his own?"
"   As to the very moment of your caving in, will you experience it as one thing  or two things, or as three, four, or five things?"
So how could they possibly understand the inheriting of vines and  the succession of vines by means of these embracing vines?
 How could Soun possibly have encountered the  goings and comings of the Ancestral Master?
?
"Since no sentient being exists outside the threefold  world, why would there be some other place where the Buddha would  transform Himself for their sake?"
"Were there no  sentient beings, who is it that could be converted by a Buddha?"
"djb   CX)    Great Master Gensha Shibi once asked his disciple Jizo  Keichin, “Just how do you understand the saying ‘The threefold world  is simply your mind?"
"As to the Great Master’s statement,  “When giving a name to that thing, I see it as be bamboo and wood,” what did he  call it prior to his naming it as bamboo and wood in the present instance?"
"In its  jewel-like brilliance up to that moment, had it always been—beginning, middle,  and end—bamboo and wood?"
"In his calling it bamboo and wood at this time, is he  saying that this is synonymous with the threefold world simply being one’s mind?"
Or is he not saying that this is synonymous with the threefold world simply being  one’s mind?
"If we ourselves were different from the Buddhas in the ten directions, how  could we possibly realize what the Buddhas in all the ten quarters have taught?"
"So, what  further is to be said?"
And why?
"Although the whole  universe in all ten directions, among other things, is constantly  presenting itself in this manner, how could they possibly know it?"
Can the Buddha Dharma not exist when  inside and outside are not one and the same?
What is this ‘inside and outside’?
And what does he mean by ‘space’?
"Oan speaks of mind arising and thoughts moving, and yet there is the  fundamental principle that the Mind never moves, so how could there possibly be  an arising of mind within the twenty-four hours of a day?"
"And what, pray, is the moving of one’s thoughts?"
Do thoughts move or do  they not move?
Or are they beyond moving and not moving?
What is this ‘moving’  of his?
"Moreover, what is ‘not moving’?"
What is he calling ‘thoughts’?
Do  thoughts occur within the twenty-four hours of a day?
Or do the twenty-four hours  of a day occur within one’s thoughts?
Or can there be a time beyond these two?
But what is this Matter that can be understood easily?
Is ‘easily understood’ something he is saying about the Teaching of the Buddhas  and Ancestors?
How can one of such limited ability as his possibly  be up to ‘wishing to understand easily’?
"If the  Buddha’s Dharma was like what he said, how could It possibly have come down to  us today?"
And why?
And why?
"Shobogenzo: On Buddhist Scriptures        My late Master, the monk of Tendo, was always laughing at this and would   say:   How could ‘learning what Buddha is’ possibly be like that?"
What free time do we have for  including the dubious remarks of modern-day trainees?
" Even though someone has not yet clarified what the Great Matter is,  how could anyone who is committed to exploring It through their training fail to  rise to the occasion while listening to the Dharma and simply be dumbstruck like  that?"
And why?
How can we possibly think that his Four Perspectives  partake of the flavor of the Dharma or that it serves as a compass that points the  correct way to explore the Teaching?
"In the times  before Rinzai arrived and Ummon appeared, what, pray, did the Buddhas and  Ancestors rely upon as Their standard for exploring the Way?"
"They say that one need not  make use of Buddhist Scriptures, but what about our Master Bodhidharma’s poem?"
Do they make use of it or do they feel that they do not need it?
Would they have us use his Teaching or discard It?
"Were they  to say that our Ancestor’s Truth is not the Buddha’s Truth, who then would trust  our Ancestor’s Truth?"
"If there were someone who  had not received the authentic Transmission of the Buddha’s Truth, who, pray,  would call him ‘my Ancestral Master’?"
"If there were one of our Ancestral Masters who  had not had the Buddha’s Truth authentically Transmitted to him, how would he be  able to face either ordinary people or those in higher realms?"
"Given that, how could such heirs possibly not know  Buddhist Scriptures, or fail to clarify them, or fail to recite them?"
"If you throw out the Way of the  Buddhas, will you not be throwing out the Way of the Ancestors?"
And why is that?
"If our Fifth Chinese Ancestor Daiman Konin had not been a true spiritual friend  and guide who was able to recognize ‘such a person’, how, pray, could this  possibly have come about as it did?"
"Now, meditation in its narrow sense is simply one among  various practices, so how could it suffice to say that this was all there  was to the Saintly One?"
Who was it that invented the name ‘the Zen sect’?
How could  anyone who knows the Treasure House of the Eye of the True Teaching call the  Buddha’s Way by a wrong name?
"Shobogenzo: On the Buddha s Way        equipped with eyes, or should we consider that they were not yet equipped with the  Eye?"
"djb   CX)    Emperor Wen of the Chou dynasty asked his wise minister  Taikung, “Why is it that our society is in ever-increasing turmoil,  putting the nation in peril?"
How could those folks who follow worldly ways possibly  recognize the Buddha’s True Teaching?
How could they possibly become Buddhas  and Ancestors?
"If everyone in the Buddha’s Way set up  his own unique way, how could the Buddha’s Way possibly have come down to us  today?"
Who would honor principles  that individual people had set up on their own?
"If each person sets up his own  principles, who could determine which were true and which were false?"
"If the true and the false cannot  be determined, who could recognize what was actually the Buddha Dharma?"
What was there to  prevent them from using a name that they could have used while they were still  alive?
Shobogenzo: On the Buddha s Way        from what words of the Buddha did the name ‘Buddha Mind sect’ come?
Why do  people today speak of a ‘Buddha Mind sect’?
Why would the World-honored One  feel the need to call His mind a sect?
And why should a sect ever be connected to a  mind?
How could anyone possibly accrue any  merit by disregarding the Treasure House of the Eye of the True Teaching?
"In that the World-honored One had not already given His  name to a sect, why should His children use such names after His parinirvana?"
Who could be more spiritually skillful than the World-honored One?
"Again, if the Buddhas and the Ancestors have  not acted contrary to the Way in the past by setting up sects in Their own names,  who of His children would name a sect after themselves?"
And when can we say for certain that nothing is hidden?
"How could any     Shobogenzo: On the Heart-to-Heart Language of Intimacy        of the hundreds of thousands in that assembly possibly fail to have witnessed that  His holding the flower aloft, His eyes atwinkle, was a holding aloft of a Flower,  with His Eye atwinkle?"
How does that other bunch understand ‘Makakasho’s face breaking into a  smile’?
"Later, the World-honored  One said, “I have the Treasure House of the Eye of the True Teaching, which is the  Wondrous Heart of Nirvana, and I have transmitted It to Makakasho.” Is His  speaking in this way using speech or not using speech?"
"And then, how could  Makakasho fail to understand and how could the assembly fail to hear?"
How could those of broad experience possibly have secrets?
"And  how much less can there be secret talk or secret intentions when one is wholly  equipped with sharp eyes and sharp ears, or with the Eye of wisdom and the Ear of  wisdom, or with a Buddha’s Eye and a Buddha’s Ear?"
But who among you is not inherently keen?
"Once he had  heard It, how could he have failed to speak out?"
"At this moment I would like to ask Baso, “What is it that you call ‘sentient  beings’?"
"For the time being, you should diligently explore this through your training  by asking yourself and others, “Just what is a sentient being?"
"If it were so, then who could  not hear the Dharma that is expressed by the nonsentient?"
"Shobogenzo: On the Dharma That Nonsentient Beings Express        expressing the Dharma for the sake of the saintly ones, but is It put in a saintly way  or in an ordinary, everyday way?"
Does he not hear It  because he has gone beyond the mundane and transcended the saintly?
Or does he  not hear It because he has torn asunder the old nest of ‘the worldly versus the  saintly’?
"Might his “Fortunately for you, I...” be that of an  Ancestor of the Buddha?"
Now I would like to put it to  the National Teacher—and I am not asking about sentient beings after they hear the  Dharma—how is it with sentient beings at the very moment when they hear the  Dharma being expressed?
Shobogenzo: On the Dharma That Nonsentient Beings Express        after an effort of three seasons or four months?
"Even though Tozan had seen and  heard the underlying principle that the National Teacher expressed as, “The  Dharma that the nonsentient express can be heard by the saintly,” nevertheless he  now, once again, asked, “What person can hear the Dharma that the nonsentient  express?” Does this confirm what the National Teacher said?"
Should we see what  Tozan said as a question or should we see it as a statement?
"If he was not agreeing  with the National Teacher in general, how could he possibly have spoken as he  did?"
"If he was agreeing with the National Teacher in general, how could he  possibly have failed to understand what the National Teacher was saying?"
"How can the intellectual efforts of ordinary, worldly people possibly  catch sight of how the mighty force of one’s practice comes to behold Body and  Mind?"
"If people forget what they have heard while attending a Dharma  talk and go blank once they have left their seat, what benefit do you  think there would be in that?"
What learning could possibly be gained  by that?
What is this thing we  call ‘nonsentient’?
What is it that we call ‘the nonsentient’?
And what is it that we  call ‘expressing the Dharma’?
How can water be inherently pure or inherently  impure?
"Were the situation as those befuddled persons say, even if we were to  reduce the five vital organs and the six forms of entrails to particles of dust so  minute that they were like empty space, and then completely use up the waters of  the great ocean in washing them, unless we washed the inside of these particles,  how could they possibly be immaculate?"
"And unless we washed the inside of  empty space, how could we possibly achieve complete immaculacy within and  without?"
Who can fathom It by  using conventional ways of thinking?
Shobogenzo: On Washing Your Face        ordinary eyes?
How many unstained methods have  already disappeared there?
How can what anyone is  thinking about be based on not deliberately thinking about something ?
"And even more, how  could there possibly be many who had a one-to-one meeting with him and made  their prostrations to him?"
"Once rid of them, he would say, “If they are not ‘such a one’, what, pray, do they  want to achieve?"
"In  private, I thought to myself, “What could they possibly have done wrong that even  though they are his countrymen, he would not allow them to dwell with him?"
"By  what good fortune have I been permitted to enter his monastery, even though I am  an alien seed from a distant foreign land?"
And why is that?
"How often does it happen in everyday life that,  while looking respectfully at the Treasure House of the Eye of the True Teaching of  the Buddha Tathagata, we vainly fail to break into a smile when His eyes twinkle?"
How could the saying ‘one flower comprised of five petals’ possibly be limited to  just these five generations?
Are those who have come after the Sixth Ancestor not  to be spoken of?
"When I quietly reflect upon this poem, I realize that even if you dear old veteran  monks in all ten quarters within the three periods of time have let go of your  bodies, if you have no equivalent of “The Plum Tree has blossomed early this  spring,” who would say that you have expressed the Matter fully?"
"Accordingly, you need to keep in mind that, as a disciple who had received  the Face-to-Face Transmission of Shakyamuni Buddha and as one who had already  experienced the fourth fruit of arhathood and was awaiting his rebirth in the world  as a present-day Buddha,  how could the Venerable One possibly not have  encountered Shakyamuni Buddha?"
How do we know this is so?
"Past and present are rare enough, and what ending will  they have?"
" Who  would know that an awakened one, one whose perspective is beyond duality, has  transformed his body and transformed his mental functioning within the stream of  his words, for he has transformed his speech within the stream of his words?"
Of what use is it to go through the motions of arbitrarily turning our  head?
" Now, why is it that the Eye of Bodhidharma and the Nose of Gautama  are newly born from within the Womb of some pillar of the temple?"
What mountain or  ocean would not be a Scripture of the Buddha?
"The  Buddha’s mouth has always been open throughout myriad ancient times, so on  what occasion has there not been His voicing of Scriptures?"
"How can we fail to rejoice in having  been bom in a time when we have met this Scriptural Teaching of His, which  permits us to encounter Shakyamuni Buddha?"
"Hearing these Scriptural words of His being recited is just  like hearing the Buddha speak directly to us, so who would not be eager to hear  them?"
"Who, pray, would  not trust in and thereby awaken to the Buddha’s words that are so true and real?"
"Thus, wholeheartedness is already the Divine Vulture Peak, so how could one’s  whole being not appear together with that Heart?"
How could it not be body and  mind together as one?
Who is so set apart  from the realm of the thirty-two marks so as not to see them?
What yardstick could possibly be used to measure  his awakening?
" Now, why did the Second Ancestor not go to  India?"
How  could their number fail to be large?
And  what kind of person does he beat them into?
To which eye or eyes does  this losing refer?
"And, in short, to what end?"
"Shobogenzo: On Everyday Life        Now then, just what could this alms bowl of his possibly be?"
Might it be the One of unyielding stone?
Might it be the Iron Man?
"Great Master Joshu Shinsai once asked a newly arrived monk,  “Have you ever come here before?”   The monk replied, “Yes, I have.”   The Master said, “Have some tea before you leave.”   He also asked another monk, “Have you ever come here  before?”   The monk replied, “No, I never have.”   The Master said, “Have some tea before you leave.”   The Prior of the monastery asked the Master, “Why did you say  to the monk who had been here before, ‘Have some tea before you  leave,’ and also say to the monk who had not been here before, ‘Have  some tea before you leave?"
"The monk’s asking, “Are  there any who can hear it?” implies “Are there any who cannot?” As to Sozan’s  saying, “There is not one person on the whole of the great earth who has not  already heard It,” I should have liked to ask him, “Putting aside, for the moment,  your remark about there being no one who has not already heard It, tell me, in the  time before the whole earth sprang into existence, where was the roar of the  Dragon then?"
"Even so, I dare to put it to you, what ultimately  is the place that is without cold or heat?"
Do you understand?
"If the Buddha’s Dharma had been Transmitted from such a position of  duality, how could It possibly have ever come down to us today?"
"Well, how about these two  players?"
"If there is an eight-stone handicap, it would hardly be a game of Go,  would it?"
Why do the transitory and the Absolute necessarily need  to be offered a fixed place?
"Without denying that he has picked  up on something, what is It that exists within the transitory?"
"   So, right now, let me ask, what for heaven’s sake does he mean by not involving  himself?"
   On Why Our Ancestral Master Came from the West   (Soshi Seirai I)    Translator’s Introduction: This short discourse focuses on the question that each trainee is  presumably keeping in mind at all times: why have I come to train?
Who is it that he is  calling a ‘someone’?
Just what is this ‘mouth’?
" Now, people may well think  of the man as dangling in space, but how could dangling in space be an  improvement on grabbing hold of a branch with his Mouth?"
Is ‘opening one’s mouth to answer another’ the same  as ‘disgorging the tree branch to answer another’ or the same as ‘disclosing the  intent behind Bodhidharma’s coming from the West to answer another’?
"Let me ask all the old sharp ones of past  and present, “Is Kyogen’s uproarious laughter what he uttered whilst up the tree, or  is it what he uttered whilst beneath the tree?"
"And it is like this because, if you were unaware of such things as  grasses and trees, how could you possibly have a body and a mind?"
"And if you had  no body or mind, how could you possibly know of grasses and trees?"
"Within the True Nature of all things, which is Buddha Nature, how could  there possibly be such things as grasses and trees?"
"And how could such things as  grasses and trees not be Buddha Nature, which is the True Nature of all things?"
How can all the monks who have already received the alms you’ve  offered in good faith possibly fail to do their training?
"This  present alms offering of your very being is your giving rise to the intention to  realize Buddhahood, so how could those monks who received your offering  possibly fail to do the practice, and do it correctly from start to finish?"
  And why?
"  At the very moment of sitting, just what is that  ‘sitting’?"
Is it our mind doing somersaults?
Or is it like a fish freely disporting in  water?
Or is it thinking about something?
Or is it striving after something?
Or not  striving after anything?
"Just seeing a picture of someone seated within a lotus  blossom is enough to frighten the Lord of Demons, and how much  more so, should he actually see someone who is experiencing the  Truth whilst sitting peacefully without any agitation?"
And  why?
"Shobogenzo: On the  Methods of Training for Realizing Enlightenment        is not the kesa that your mother gave birth to, then the Buddhas and Ancestors do  not use it—how could Shonawashu have been the only one ?"
Ask yourself: precisely what is suffering?
"In the time before evil deeds have arisen,  where are they?"
What should we call evil deeds that have not yet  arisen?
Who has known or seen them?
Where is the top of this  hundred-foot pole?
"Were this not so, how could He have possibly been continually  zealous in His endeavors?"
How could He have possibly already realized It?
"How  can those who are academic teachers of Buddhism and those who write scholarly  commentaries on Scriptures possibly encounter or hear about this principle, much  less explore it through training with a Master?"
How can those  folks who are not up to leaving home life behind possibly devote themselves to  attaining the rank of Buddha?
Do you not see?
"Generally speaking, people’s understanding of  movement and silence differ, so how can they say that the Venerable Shakyamuni  is like any of these types or even different from them?"
How could the Buddha’s Teaching  ever be mixed up with ‘movement versus stillness’?
 How could  that bunch who do not understand this possibly call themselves persons of the  Buddha’s Way?
"Even so, what bright-eyed person would be deceived by such folks?"
"And even less, how can any present-day trainees  who are descendants of Zen veteran Soko possibly understand the words  ‘awakening to one’s True Self?"
And what is the reason for that?
"In the old man’s saying that he had been reduced to being reborn as a wild  fox for five hundred lives, how, pray, did such a thing come about?"
How could ‘cause and effect’ possibly be  like that?
"If being reduced to  the state of a wild fox was the inevitable consequence of answering a trainee’s  question inaccurately, then how many thousands of myriad times would the  Rinzais and Tokusans of more recent times, along with their disciples, have been  reduced to being wild foxes as a consequence?"
"In     Shobogenzo: On the Great Practice        the old man’s remark, “I was reduced to being reborn as a wild fox for five  hundred lives,” what is it that was reborn and what was that reduced to?"
"At the  very moment when he was reborn as a wild fox, what form did his previous  universe now take on?"
How is the phrase ‘not being subject to causality’ related to  his being reborn five hundred times?
And where did the pelt that was now lying  beneath a rock on the other side of the mountain come from?
How could a wild fox have possibly known of its five hundred lives?
"But over the generations, who could have known this on the wild fox’s  behalf?"
"But the main point is this: how could a dead fox become a  dead monk, since it has never taken the Precepts, or attended a summer retreat, or  kept to the everyday behavior of a monk, or held to the principles of a monk?"
"Even though the former Hyakujo  referred to himself as a dead fox at the base of a rock, how could this possibly be  the usual way great monks behave?"
How could it have been the bones and marrow  of an Ancestor of the Buddha?
Who is there to prove that it was the former  Hyakujo?
Just what is it  getting at?
"Are  the five hundred lives that are being spoken of here to be reckoned as they would  be in the world of humans, or should they be counted as a wild fox would  experience them, or are they to be counted as a Buddha would refer to them?"
"And  what is more, how could the eyes of an old wild fox possibly have caught sight of  what a Hyakujo is?"
"So now I dare ask each of you trainees,   '‘Have you also spit out all of your fox drivel?"
"So, why did Obaku arbitrarily say that the old man  gave the wrong response which produced this transformation?"
"Who knows how many     Shobogenzo: On Conferring the Face-to-Face Transmission        thousands of myriad transformations He had been through, breaking His bones and  shattering His body to bits in His efforts?"
" If you have not  realized a genuine fruition by this time, at what time will you realize a genuine  fruition?"
"If you have not cut off your delusions by this time, at what time will you  cut them off?"
"Should you not have become Buddha by this time, at what time will  you become Buddha?"
"Should you not be sitting as a Buddha at this time, at what  time will you practice being a Buddha?"
Do all of you also see him?
Do  you see him?
"Yet given that it is already a hundred or  more years since Ummon entered nirvana, how can I possibly make  the assertion that the two of us had an intimate encounter?"
"Those  who have been able to see do not talk about it, and those who have not  yet seen, should they not look right now?"
"Shobogenzo: On Conferring the Face-to-Face Transmission        Now Joko, even if you had known all about Great Master Ummon and had  seen Great Master Ummon, has Great Master Ummon seen you?"
"Among the Seven Buddhas, along with all the other Buddhas of the past, present,  and future, is there any Ancestor of the Buddhas who has been heir to the Dharma  without Master and disciple having met each other?"
How can  you possibly gauge Obaku’s daily behavior or fathom Obaku’s words and phrases?
Didn’t you know in what sense Great Master Ummon really is a Dharma  descendant of Obaku?
 How could you possibly sound the depths of what Hyakujo  and Obaku were talking about?
Is it due to some formidable power of yours that you have heard Ummon  name you as an heir?
Do you know what he meant by ‘my own’ and who his descendants are?

"CX) (X>   Joko, if, as you claim, it is possible to inherit the Dharma by relying on  written words, then do all those who have given rise to enlightenment by reading  Scriptures inherit the Dharma from Shakyamuni Buddha Himself?"
"For,  altogether, how could the Unbounded be limited to a mere twenty types of  emptiness, since there are at least eighty-four thousand types of emptiness?"
"If someone here today  should suddenly ask me what a miracle is, I would simply say to that  person, “What is miraculous in the first place?” Ultimately, what else  is there?"
"In short, how could His sequestering  Himself in a cave and sitting in meditation for the summer possibly be beyond  speaking or beyond expressing the Teaching?"
"Let’s suppose for the moment that  Ananda had asked the World-honored One, “How am I to express the meaning of  ‘All thoughts and things are beyond arising, and all thoughts and things are beyond  decay’?"
What mass annihilation would he have then created?
"Meditation Master Engo added a verse to this commentary of his:   A great elephant does not play about in the narrow path  that a rabbit makes,      And what coidd a little bird know of a great wild swan?"
"Makakasho raised his hammer, but in which place will he  punish Manjushri?"
"He then  entered the meditative state of delight in the Self, so the Tripitaka  Master was unable to perceive his whereabouts.”   Kaie Shutan once said, “If the National Teacher was right on the  tip of the Tripitaka Master’s nose, why was he having such difficulty  seeing it?"
"Scholars who are students of Scriptures are ordinary, unenlightened  people, so how could they possibly comprehend the National Teacher’s Whole  Being?"
"I must ask, if someone has not already come to know the Way  of the Buddhas and Ancestors, what is one to do, for such a person is of no use to  the Way of the Buddhas?"
How could anyone who attaches any importance to  moments of time waste them by dabbling with the five and six abilities?
"The  National Teacher was an Ancestor of the Buddha, whereas the Tripitaka Master  was an ordinary, everyday person, so how can anyone possibly take him to be the  National Teacher’s equal in any spiritual discussion?"
How could the National Teacher possibly be right on the tip of the  Tripitaka Master’s nose when the latter still lacked a Nose?
Just what is this ‘being much too close’?
"I  should like to ask Shibi at this time, “What are you calling ‘being too close’?"
Do  you call it a Fist?
"Kaie Shutan said, “If the National Teacher was right on the tip of the  Tripitaka Master’s nose, why was the latter having such difficulty seeing it?"
"He did not  reprimand the Tripitaka Master, as he should have, for failing to see the first two  times, so how could he possibly recognize that the National Teacher was on the tip  of the Tripitaka Master’s nose or inside his Eye?"
" If the latter had reprimanded the Tripitaka  Master simply for failing to know the third time, who could trust the National  Teacher’s judgment?"
"Shobogenzo: On Reading the Minds and Hearts of Others        Let me ask you right now: which is better, to use your ability in order to see  into the minds of others or to use it to see into your own mind?"
What ultimately is It?
Shobogenzo: On ‘The King Requests Something from Sindh ’        was this the king asking for something from Sindh?
Or was it the offering of  something from Sindh?
"Kyogen said, “Your noodle-headed act could get someone  killed!”   Now, let us ask, is the basis of Kyogen’s remark, “Come over here,” his asking for  something from Sindh or is it his offering something from Sindh?"
Was the monk’s having gone over to him based on Kyogen’s  asking for something or based on Kyogen’s offering something?
Or was either of  these even Kyogen’s original intention?
 Who can say that  they do not understand the taking up of the traveling staff and the raising of the  hossu?
"”   If in the Buddha s assembly, there had been any trainee  from Sindh,   Why would Manjushri possibly have needed to sound  even one single clap?"
"For instance, someone asks, “What is Buddha?” and  the Master asserts, “Your very mind is Buddha!” What does this mean?"
Would this  assertion not be ‘something from Sindh’?
"You need to explore in detail through  your training with your Master who it really is that says, “Your very mind is  Buddha!” Would any of you know that it is striking, and being struck by,  something from Sindh?"
"Had they not distanced themselves from their faults and  guarded against misdeeds, how could they have realized Buddhahood  and become an Ancestor?"
"Assuming the form of a Buddha, being provided with the Precepts and  the monastic regulations, and acquiring what the Buddha received and  made use of are, by no means, small matters, so how could you  possibly treat them lightly?"
Dare I hope that you will engrave it on your heart?
Perhaps the deciding question is for whom did Dogen intend this talk?
"At any point where we  can encounter, or hear about, and learn through practice the Teaching contained in  “While still young, one may leave home life behind,” we encounter the Buddha’s    monastery to let go of such values, thinking, and behaving?"
Or was he upbraiding monks  who were disinclined to give up their pursuit of worldly interests?
"The young Brahman  Jambukadaka once asked Shariputra, ‘Within the Buddha Dharma  what is the most difficult thing to do?"
"’   “Shariputra responded, ‘Leaving home life behind is the most  difficult to achieve.’   “The Brahman then asked, ‘What are the difficulties in leaving  home life behind?"
"’   “Shariputra replied, ‘In leaving home life behind, contentment  is the most difficult to achieve.’   “The Brahman then asked, ‘When one has attained  contentment, what then is the most difficult to attain?"
"’   “They then asked her, ‘If we break the Precepts, then we shall  certainly fall into some hellish state, so why would you have us break  them?’   “She replied, ‘If you fall into some hell, then you fall into some   hell.’   “All the women broke out in laughter and said, ‘In a hell we  will receive the consequences of our defiling deeds, so why would  you have us fall into such a state?"
And why is this so?
What sage person  would not be delighted to seek for them?
And why?
 Who  could accept it in good faith?
Who could bear to hear such a thing?
"For those who may well not be princes, what can there possibly be to regret?"
 Who could fail to see that they were  bunglers?
Who could fail to see that they were foolish people?
So why  would he not hasten to do so?
What kind of tomorrow should he have waited for?
"Had they not distanced themselves from their faults and  guarded against misdeeds, how could they have realized Buddhahood  and become an Ancestor?"

"True, we have been born in a remote country and have been exposed to the  Dharma in Its final days, sad to say, but even so, in that we have encountered the  robe and the Teaching as received by Buddha after Buddha for generation after  generation, what greater joy could there be?"
Which other tradition has correctly  Transmitted both the robe and the Dharma of the Venerable Shakyamuni as we  have straightforwardly Transmitted them?
How could this possibly be due to the  cultivation of spiritual merits under the tutelage of just one or two Buddhas?
"Shobogenzo: On the Spiritual Merits of the Kesa        animals repay kindliness, how could humans fail to understand kindness?"
"Even the secular Confucian teachings admonish us not to wear  clothing which differs from that officially worn during the time of the previous  ruler, so why would a disciple of the Buddha wear any type of robe other than that  which the Buddha wore?"
Through what good fortune  have we encountered the Teaching whereby the World-honored Tathagata directly  Transmitted the robe and the Dharma?
"In addition, there are some among the Scriptural  teachers of the Lesser Course who hold to the theory of transformed thread,  a  view which has no foundation and at which persons of the Greater Course must  smile, for what thread is not the product of some form of transformation?"
"A certain monk once asked the ancient Buddha Daikan Eno, “Is  the robe passed on to you on Huang-mei Mountain in the middle of  the night one made of cotton or one made of silk?"
"To have received the body of a human  being in the Southern Continent of Jambudvipa, to have met with the Dharma of  Shakyamuni Buddha by being born in proximity to an Ancestral Master who is in  the direct line of inheritors of the Buddha Dharma, and then, to no profit, to pass  up accepting a kesa that has been directly Transmitted from person to person, a  kesa that points directly to one’s Buddha Nature—could there be anything more  pathetic?"
And what are  these nine?
And what are these two?
And  just how should such a one dispel this feeling?
How  could I not regret the days and years I had so vainly spent or not grieve their  passing?
"As the Tathagata said in the Lotus  Scripture ,   I constantly make this My intention:   How may I help living beings  Enter the Unsurpassed Way  And quickly realize Buddhahood?"
"Thus, if we  employ enlightened Mind in making an alms offering of grass and trees, tiles and  stones, gold and silver, and rare treasures, which all sentient beings hold onto as if  these things were their own possessions, how could this not be our giving rise to  enlightened Mind?"
"Now, there is a nimble  man who comes along and says to them, ‘Now, if you will all shoot  off your arrows at the same time, I will be able to catch them all  before any of them touch the ground.’ What do you think?"
"The Buddha once said, “How do bodhisattvas protect the One  Great Matter, which is enlightened Mind?"
"How could people who have never  made alms offerings to even one Buddha ever become Buddhas themselves, since  they lack a cause for becoming a Buddha?"
"Even so, those Buddhas did not foretell My  future, saying, ‘You will certainly realize Buddhahood in some future  lifetime.’ And why was that?"
"Even so, those  Buddhas did not foretell My future, saying, ‘You will certainly realize  Buddhahood in some future lifetime.’ And why was that?"
"Shobogenzo: On Making Venerative Offerings to Buddhas        Buddhas did not foretell My future, saying, ‘You will certainly realize  Buddhahood in some future lifetime.’ And why was that?"
And  why?
Of what value is gold or silver to a Buddha?
Of what value are  incense and flowers to a Buddha?
Who would  not take delight in it?
"What can be  more wonderful than our being so fortunate as to obtain something so precious, as  we now climb the Treasured Mountain of the Buddha’s Way and enter the  Treasured Ocean of the Buddha’s Way?"
Shobogenzo: On Making Venerative Offerings to Buddhas        honored One was pointing us to?
And why is this?
 So  how could they possibly fully realize that the True Form of all thoughts and things  is something that each and every Buddha has penetrated through and through?
"The  Buddha’s intention is profound, so who is there that would not sound its depths?"
"The World-honored One, seeing the dragon woman’s blindness  and the depth of her suffering, asked her from His great  compassionate heart, “My little sister, what conditions have caused  you to have such a wretched body?"
"Now, in the final, degenerate five  hundred years following the disappearance of the Tathagata, what can we humans  do?"
" Because the Waters of  Dharma are untainted and pure, they can save people, so how come  you crave to have them by prideful means?"
"So, why, pray,  would you neglect to fathom them?"
And how do we know that they have denied causality?
"Simply, do you get It, or not?"
And why?
"How come he has had such good fortune and where have  we gone wrong?”   The Venerable One responded, “Why do you entertain such  doubts?"
How could you  possibly have carried out such a wicked act of betrayal now?
"Since all that  the Buddhas and Ancestors have been expressing had not been Transmitted to you,  Chosa, who could esteem and respect you?"
But how could ‘karmic  hindrance’ mean ‘something that has been empty all along’?
"Since karmic  hindrances are something created by our actions, how can something we have  created be ‘empty all along’?"
"If there had not been a Nansen, who would you have  exchanged the Eyes of training with?"
"As to the one True Nature of which you spoke, just what is that ‘True Nature’?"
"Pray, which among the three natures do you consider It to be ?"
Shobogenzo: On Karmic Retribution in the Three Temporal Periods        say that you do not know that ‘our True Nature’ refers to ‘nirvana being our having  paid off our old debts?
"’ When you speak of nirvana, what is this nirvana of yours?"
Would it be the nirvana of the shravakas?
 Or the nirvana of the  pratyekabuddhas?
 Or the nirvana of the Buddha?
Why would you want to resemble those transgressors  who caused such harm?
"This is not your final body, nor is it a body that will not  have an intermediate world, so why would you not experience retribution in some  future lifetime?"
"How could  he possibly have compared the way the first, second, third, and fourth meditative  states appear with the way the first, second, third, and fourth stages of arhathood  appear?"
"And what’s more, it had been a  long time since he had realized the fourth meditative state, so why did he not  realize upon reflection that it could not be the fourth stage of arhathood?"
"And if he  already knew that it was not the fourth stage of arhathood, why did he not correct  his thinking?"
Who among those who have pursued a study of the Buddha  Dharma would be unable to fathom the teachings of Confucius or Lao-tzu ?
" But  among those who have devoted themselves to a study of Confucius or Lao-tzu,  have any ever been able to fathom what the Buddha Dharma is?"
Where have any of the Seven Buddhas or  our twenty-eight Indian Ancestors said that the Buddha Dharma is merely the  seeing of one’s True Nature?
"Such people  would like to equate such Taoist terms as ‘the meritorious function of  the Tao’ or ‘just strolling along’,  with the teaching of liberation in  the Buddha Dharma, but how could such as this possibly be?"
"How  could an ordinary, secular person who is truly keeping to his worldly occupation be  free enough to accommodate himself to others?"
"O Chi’en and Shoju, I ask  you, what brilliance do you two have that you would disregard what former  virtuous ones have expressed by arbitrarily asserting that Confucius and Lao-tzu  are surely the equals of the Buddha’s Dharma?"
"Since this does not compare with the benefits  from the Buddha Dharma in all three temporal periods, how could  theirs possibly not be a mistaken view?"
"Our Fourteenth Ancestor, the bodhisattva Nagarjuna once said, “The great  arhats and the pratyekabuddhas had direct knowledge of eighty thousand great  eons, whereas the great bodhisattvas and the Buddha had direct knowledge of  immeasurable eons.” People like Confucius and Lao-tzu never knew the past and  future within their own single age, so how could they possibly have known of a  couple of their past lives?"
How much less could they have possibly known even a  single eon?
How much less could they have possibly known a hundred eons or a  thousand eons?
How much less could they have possibly known eighty thousand  great eons?
And how much less could they have known an immeasurable eon?
"Shobogenzo: On the Monk in the Fourth Meditative State        karma that fills us up and the karma that pulls us along,  or about understanding  what past and future are, he was ignorant of the present, so how could he possibly  be the equal of the Buddha Dharma?"
"Further, why do they  not say that seeing the whole universe is like seeing a single dust mote?"
"They could not have known anything about the small¬  thousandfold worlds or the middle-thousandfold worlds, so how could there have  been a mler who had encountered or known about three-thousand great¬  thousandfold worlds?"
"They never knew  anything of the path to achieving liberation through renouncing the world, so how  could they possibly have fully realized the True Nature of all things as the  Tathagata did?"
"If they had not fully realized It, how could they possibly have been  the equal of the World-honored One?"
Shobogenzo: On the Monk in the Fourth Meditative State        voice to the false teaching that the three are of one accord?
"The World-honored One  saw the most minute forms and knew directly how long the shortest span of a  moment is, so how could we possibly treat Confucius or Lao-tzu as one equal to  Him?"
"They could not have even come up to the level of a stream-entrant  of the Lesser Course, so how could they possibly have been the equal of those at  the second, third, or fourth stages of arhathood?"
"In the  gateway to the Tathagata’s Teaching, great compassion is the starting  point of training, so how could Lao-tzu have possibly made such a  topsy-turvy view the basis for his method of teaching?"
" How could those  legendary three emperors and five rulers of antiquity, of whom Confucians speak,  possibly come up to the level of the Wheel-turning Lords of the Gold, Silver,  Copper, and Iron Wheels, who are equipped with thousands of the seven precious  jewels and who have governance over the four continents or rule some three¬  thousandfold world?"
"Shobogenzo: On the Monk in the Fourth Meditative State        standards for social behavior.” Keep in mind that our Second Ancestor had already  thoroughly grasped that the teachings of Confucius and Lao-tzu were devoid of the  Buddha Dharma, so why do his distant descendants go counter to their ancestral  parent and insist that the teachings of Confucius and Lao-tzu are in accord with the  Buddha’s Dharma?"
So what is it that you so desire to seek from Me?
"But when it comes to Confucius and Lao-tzu  who never entered the Buddha’s Way, how could we possibly say that they are the  equals of Buddhas?"
And who would want to become stuck in their own mind?
And what is the way whereby people extricate  themselves?
"Were the question raised  like this, how would you respond so that you would keep your Dharma Body alive  and not sink into the sea of suffering?"
And why is that so?
"So, how can it be understood?"
"One way that you may come to understand them is to inquire from the  perspective of someone who has been born, “What is this ‘being alive?’” Who of  us has clarified from beginning to end what it is?"
"How, then, are we to  understand this notion of the Buddhas being the same as us?"
"When the Original Mind of the Buddhas of the three temporal  worlds is practicing the Way, what could possibly come from left field to turn It  aside?"
"It being assumed that the end to be aimed  at is not life but ' living well,' i. e. filling life with the  right kind of contents, what, in this view of it, is the most  expedient course to take ?"
Is he  then by a signal act of disloyalty to purchase a few more  years of useless and precarious existence and to desert  his post for fear of death ?
What then is piety ?
"Piety is what is dear to the gods, and impiety is what is not dear to them, but  may there not be differences of opinion, as among men,  so also among the gods?"
"If all the circumstances of the  case are considered, are you able to show that your   father was guilty of murder, or that all the gods are  agreed in approving of our prosecution of him ?"
And  must you not allow that what is hated by one god may  be liked by another ?
But what is the meaning of 'attending ' to the gods?
But how do pious or holy acts make the  gods any better ?
"To what end do we serve the gods, and what do we help them to accom  plish?"
"But although  they are the givers of all good, how can we give them  any good in return ?"
have you left the Lyceum?
What are you doing in the Porch of the King Archon?
"Surely you cannot  be concerned in a suit before the King, like myself?"
Then some one else has been prosecuting you ?
And who is he ?
But  what is the charge which he brings against you ?
What is the charge?
But in what way  does he say that you corrupt the young ?
"And what is your suit, Euthyphro ?"
are you the  pursuer or the defendant ?
Of whom ?
"Why, has the fugitive wings ?"
Who is he ?
my good man ?
And of what is he accused ?
Now the man who is dead was a poor  dependant of mine who worked for us as a field      If such a charge impious?
"and is your know  ledge of religion and of things pious and impious so  very exact, that, supposing the circumstances to be as  you state them, you are not afraid lest you too may be   I doing an impious thing in bringing an action against  your father ?"
What should I be  good for without it ?
What is Piety?
What are they?
Is not piety in every action always the same?
"Impiety, again is it not always the opposite  of piety, and also the same with itself, having, as  impiety, one notion which includes whatever is  impious?"
"And what is piety, and what is impiety ?"
For do not men regard Zeus as  the best and most righteous of the gods ?
"May not this be the reason, Euthyphro, why  I am charged with impiety that I cannot away with  these stories about the gods ?"
"What     Piety is what pleases the gods     else can I say, confessing as I do, that I know nothing  about them ?"
"And do you really believe that the gods fought  with one another, and had dire quarrels, battles, and  the like, as the poets say, and as you may see  represented in the works of great artists ?"
"Are all  these tales of the gods true, Euthyphro ?"
"But just at present  [ would rather hear from you a more precise answer,  which you have not as yet given, my friend, to the  question, What is ' piety ' ?"
"No doubt, Euthyphro ; but you would admit  that there are many other pious acts?"
But what if the gods disagree ?
"Do you not recollect that there was one idea which  made the impious impious, and the pious pious ?"
Was not that said ?
And well said ?
"And further, Euthyphro, the gods were admittej  to have enmities and hatreds and differences ?"
And what sort of difference creates enmity and  anger ?
"Suppose for example that you and I, my good  friend, differ about a number ; do differences of this sort  make us enemies and set us at variance with one another ?"
"Do we not go at once to arithmetic, and put an end to  them by a sum ?"
"Or suppose that we differ about magnitudes, do  we not quickly end the difference by measuring ?"
And we end a controversy about heavy and  light by resorting to a weighing machine ?
"But what differences are there which cannot be  thus decided, and which therefore make us angry and  set us at enmity with one another?"
"Are not these  the points about which men differ, and about which  when we are unable satisfactorily to decide our differ  ences, you and I and all of us quarrel, when we do  quarrel ' ?"
"And the quarrels of the gods, noble Euthyphro,  when they occur, are of a like nature ?"
"They have differences of opinion, as you say,  about good and evil, just and unjust, honourable and  dishonourable: there would have been no quarrels  among them, if there had been no such differences  would there now ?"
"Does not every man love that which he deems  noble and just and good, and bate the opposite of them ?"
"Then the same things are hated by the gods and  loved by the gods, and are both hateful and dear to them ?"
"And upon this view the same things, Euthyphro,  will be pious and also impious ?"
"Well, but speaking of men, Euthyphro, did you  ever hear any one arguing that a murderer or any sort  of evil-doer ought to be let off?"
"But do they admit their guilt, Euthyphro, and  yet say that they ought not to be punished ?"
"Then there are some things which they do not  venture to say and do : for they do not venture to argue  that the guilty are to be unpunished, but they deny their  guilt, do they not ?"
"Then they do not argue that the evil-doer should  not be punished, but they argue about the fact of who  the evil-doer is, and what he did and when ?"
For surely neither God nor man will  ever venture to say that the doer of injustice is not to  be punished ?
Is not that true ?
How would you show that all the  gods absolutely agree in approving of his act ?
"There was a notion that came  into my mind while you were speaking; I said to myself: 'Well, and what if Euthyphro does prove to me that  all the gods regarded the death of the serf as unjust,  how do I know anything more of the nature of piety  and impiety ?"
Shall this be our definition of  piety and impiety ?
"Why not, Socrates ?"
"Ought we to enquire into the truth of this,  Euthyphro, or simply to accept the mere statement  on our own authority and that of others?"
What do  you say ?
"You know that in all such  cases there is a difference, and you know also in what  the difference lies ?"
And is not that which is beloved distinct from  that which loves ?
"Well ; and now tell me, is that which is carried  in this state of carrying because it is carried, or for  some other reason ?"
And the same is true of what is led and of what  is seen ?
"It does not become because it is becoming,     Not love the reason of piety ?"
Do  you not agree ?
Is not that which is loved in some state either  of becoming or suffering ?
"And what do you say of piety, Euthyphro ; is  not piety, according to your definition, loved by all the  gods?"
"Because it is pious or holy, or for some other  reason ?"
"It is loved because it is holy, not holy because  it is loved ?"
"And that which is dear to the gods is loved by them, and is in a state to be loved of them because it is  loved of them ?"
"How do you mean, Socrates ?"
"And therefore, if you please, I will ask you  not to hide your treasure, but to tell me once more  what holiness or piety really is, whether dear to the  gods or not (for that is a matter about which we will  not quarrel) ; and what is impiety ?"
"Tell me, then, Is not that which is  pious necessarily just ?"
"And is, then, all which is just pious?"
"or, is  that which is pious all just, but that which is just, only la  in part and not all, pious ?"
 Are justice and piety one?
Shall I tell you in  what respect?
I suppose that you follow me now ?
Or is piety a part of justice ?
Do you dissent ?
"Then, if piety is a part of justice, I suppose  that we should enquire what part ?"
Do you not agree ?
"That is good, Euthyphro ; yet still there is a   little point about which I should like to have further in  formation, What is the meaning of 'attention'?"
Is it not so ?
I should suppose that the art of horsemanship  is the art of attending to horses ?
"Nor is every one qualified to attend to dogs, but  only the huntsman ?"
And I should also conceive that the art of the  huntsman is the art of attending to dogs ?
As the art of the oxherd is the art of attending  to oxen ?
In like manner holiness or piety is the art of  attending to the gods ?
"that would be your meaning,  Euthyphro ?"
And is not attention always designed for the  good or benefit of that to which the attention is given ?
"As in the case of horses, you may observe that when  attended to by the horseman's art they are benefited and  improved, are they not ?"
"As the dogs are benefited by the huntsman's art,  and the oxen by the art of the oxherd, and all other  things are tended or attended for their good and not for  their hurt ?"
Can men minister to the gods ?
But for their good ?
"And does piety or holiness, which has been de  fined to be the art of attending to the gods, benefit or  improve them ?"
Would you say that when you do a  holy act you make any of the gods better ?
Good : but I must still ask what is this atten  tion to the gods which is called piety ?
"Medicine is also a sort of ministration or service,  having in view the attainment of some object would  you not say of health ?"
"Again, there is an art which ministers to the  ship-builder with a view to the attainment of some  result?"
As there is an art which ministers to the house-  builder with a view to the building of a house ?
"And now tell me, my good friend, about the art  which ministers to the gods : what work does that help  to accomplish ?"
"Tell me then, oh tell me what is that fair  work which the gods do by the help of our ministra  tions ?"
Would you not  say that victory in war is the chief of them ?
"Many and fair, too, are the works of the hus  bandman, if I am not mistaken ; but his chief work is  the production of food from the earth ?"
"And of the many and fair things done by the  gods, which is the chief or principal one ?"
Is piety giving and asking?
"But I see plainly that you  are not disposed to instruct me clearly not : else why,  when we reached the point, did you turn aside ?"
"Now, as the asker  of a question is necessarily dependent on the answerer,  whither he leads I must follow ; and can only ask again,  what is the pious, and what is piety ?"
Do you mean that  they are a sort of science of praying and sacrificing ?
"And sacrificing is giving to the gods, and prayer  is asking of the gods ?"
"Upon this view, then, piety is a science of  asking and giving ?"
"Please then to tell me, what is the nature of this service to  the gods ?"
Do you mean that we prefer requests and  give gifts to them ?
Is not the right way of asking to ask of them  what we want?
 But rvbat can we give them?
"Then piety, Euthyphro, is an art which gods  and men have of doing business with one another ?"
"And do you imagine, Socrates, that any benefit  accrues to the gods from our gifts ?"
"But if not, Euthyphro, what is the meaning of  gifts which are conferred by us upon the gods ?"
"What else, but tributes of honour ; and, as I  was just now saying, what pleases them ?"
"Piety, then, is pleasing to the gods, but not  beneficial or dear to them ?"
Then once more the assertion is repeated that  piety is dear to the gods ?
"And when you say this, can you wonder at  your words not standing firm, but walking away ?"
Were we  not saying that the holy or pious was not the same with  that which is loved of the gods ?
Have you forgotten ?
And are you not saying that what is loved of  the gods is holy ; and is not this the same as what is  dear to them do you see ?
"Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety?"
"my companion, and will you leave me in  despair ?"
Is it  fanciful to suppose that he meant to give the stamp of  authenticity to the one and not to the other ?
"What could be the meaning of this  that he who knew nothing, and knew that he knew  nothing, should be declared by the oracle to be the  wisest of men?"
"The  question may be asked, Why will he persist in following  a profession which leads him to dtfath"" ?"
Why ?
Why then has he never taken part in public affairs?
Anytus proposes death as the penalty;  and what counter-proposition shall he make ?
Is it a good or an evil?
"But leaving this question, which does  not admit of a precise solution, we may go on to ask  what was the impression which Plato in the Apology  intended to give of the character and conduct of his  master in the last great scene ?"
Did he intend to  represent him as employing sophistries; as  designedly irritating the judges?
"Or are these sophistries  to be regarded as belonging to the age in which he  lived and to his personal character, and this apparent  haughtiness as flowing from the natural elevation of his  position?"
"For example, when he says that it is absurd to  suppose that one man is the corrupter and all the rest  of the world the improvers of the youth ; or, when he  argues that he never could have corrupted the men with  whom he had to live; or, when he proves his belief in  the gods because he believes in the sons of gods, is he  serious or jesting?"
"For I am more than seventy years of  age, and appearing now for the first time in a court of  law, I am quite a stranger to the language of the place ;  and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were  really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke   in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country :  Am I making an unfair request of you?"
"And so leaving the event with God, in ""?"
"Well, what do the slanderers say ?"
"There is at  this time a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of  whom I have heard ; and I came to hear of him in this  way : I came across a man who has spent a world of  money on the Sophists, Callias, the son of Hipponicus,  and knowing that he had sons, I asked him : ' Callias,'  I said, ' if your two sons were foals or calves, there  would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over  them ; we should hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer  probably, who would improve and perfect them in their  own proper virtue and excellence ; but as they are  human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over  them ?"
Is there any one who understands human and  political virtue ?
said I ; ' and of what  country ?
What is the origin of these  accusations which are brought against you; there must  have been something strange which you have been doing?
Why do I mention this?
"When  I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the  god mean?"
and what is the interpretation of his riddle ?
What then can he mean when he says that I am the  wisest of men ?
Will you believe me?
"and then if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does  he practise or teach?"
"And yet, I know that my plainness of speech makes  them hate me, and what is their hatred but a proof that  I am speaking the truth ?"
You think a great deal about the improvement of youth ?
"What, do you mean to say, Meletus, that they are  able to instruct and improve youth ?"
Who are the improvers of the youth ?
"What, all of them, or some only and not others ?"
And the senators ?
But perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt  them ?
or do they too improve them ?
Then every Athenian improves and elevates them ;  all with the exception of myself; and I alone am their  corrupter ?
Is that what you affirm ?
But suppose  I ask you a question : How about horses ?
Does one  man do them harm and all the world good ?
Is not  the exact opposite the truth ?
"One man is able to do  them good, or at least not many ; the trainer of horses,  that is to say, does them good, and others who have to  do with them rather injure them ?"
"Is not that true, Meletus, of horses, or of any other animals?"
"And now, Meletus, I will ask you another question  by Zeus I will : Which is better, to live among bad  citizens, or among good ones ?"
"Do  not the good do their neighbours good, and the bad do  them evil ?"
And is there any one who would rather be injured  than benefited by those who live with him ?
"Answer,  my good friend, the law requires you to answer does  any one like to be injured ?"
"And when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth, do you allege that I corrupt them  intentionally or unintentionally ?"
"Or, do you mean that I am an atheist  simply, and a teacher of atheism ?"
"Why do you think so, Meletus ?"
"Do you mean that I do not believe  in the godhead of the sun or moon, like other men ?"
"And so, Meletus, you really think that  I do not believe in any god ?"
"Has   he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me ?"
"And I must remind the  audience of my request that they would not make a  disturbance if I speak in my accustomed manner :   Did ever man, Meletus, believe in the existence of  human things, and not of human beings ?"
"Did ever any  man believe in horsemanship, and not in horses ?"
"or in  flute-playing, and not in flute-players ?"
"But now please to answer the next question : Can a  man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in  spirits or demigods ?"
"But then you swear in the  indictment that I teach and believe in divine or spiritual  agencies (new or old, no matter for that) ; at any rate,  I believe in spiritual agencies, so you say and swear in  the affidavit ; and yet if I believe in divine beings, how  can I help believing in spirits or demigods ; must I  not ?"
Now what are spirits     Meletus checkmated    or demigods ?
are they not either gods or the sons of  gods ?
"For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods,  whether by the nymphs or by any other mothers, of  whom they are said to be the sons what human being  will ever believe that there are no gods if they are the  sons of gods ?"
"Not death but disgrace to be feared   Some one will say : And are you not ashamed,  Socrates, of a course of life which is likely to bring you  to an untimely end ?"
Had Achilles any thought of death and danger ?
"Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of  Athens, if I who, when I was ordered by the generals     Who knows that death is an evil?"
"Is not this  ignorance of a disgraceful sort, the ignorance which is  the conceit that a man knows what he does not know ?"
"And therefore if you let me go now, and are not con  vinced by Anytus, who said that since I had been  prosecuted I must be put to death : (or if not that I  ought never to have been prosecuted at all) ; and that if  I escape now, your sons will all be utterly ruined by  listening to my words if you say to me, Socrates, this      The mission of Socrates   time we will not mind Anytus, and you shall be let off,  but upon one condition, that you are not to enquire and  speculate in this way any more, and that if you are  caught doing so again you shall die ; if this was the  condition on which you let me go, I should reply :  Men of Athens, I honour and love you ; but I shall  obey God rather than you, and while I have life and  strength I shall never cease from the practice and  teaching of philosophy, exhorting any one whom I meet  and saying to him after my manner : You, my friend,  a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of  Athens, are you not ashamed of heaping up the great  est amount of money and honour and reputation, and  caring so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest  improvement of the soul, which you never regard or  heed at all ?"
"For I do nothing but go about persuading you  all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your  persons or your properties, but first and chiefly to care     Hit rejection of compromise ?"
"His cross-examination of pretenders    Now do you really imagine that I could have  survived all these years, if I had led a public life,  supposing that like a good man I had always maintained  the right and had made justice, as I ought, the first  thing ?"
"But I shall be asked, Why do people delight in  continually conversing with you ?"
"And let him say, if he has any  testimony of the sort which he can producefj Nay,  Athenians, the very opposite is the truth.i For all     Who are his accusers ?"
Why should they too support me  with their testimony?
And why not ?
"I may say more ; for without the  assistance of Anytus and Lycon, any one may see that         Penalty or reward?"
"And   what shall I propose on my part, O men of Athens ?"
And what is my due ?
What shall be done to  such an one ?
"What would be a reward  suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and who desires leisure that he may instruct you ?"
"There  can be no reward so fitting as maintenance in the  Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which he  jV deserves far more than the citizen who has won the  prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race, whether   - fylPt   \ w/n             What shall be the penalty ?"
Why should I ?
Because  I am afraid of the penalty of death which Meletus  proposes ?
"When I do not know whether death is a  good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which  would certainly be an evil ?"
Shall I say imprisonment ?
"And why should I live in prison, and be the clave of  the magistrates of the year of the Eleven ?"
"Or shall  the penalty be a fine, and imprisonment until the fine is  paid ?"
"Some one will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you  hold your tongue, and then you may go into a foreign  city, and no one will interfere with you ?"
"Not so ; the deficiency which led to my conviction  was not of words certainly not.TBut I had not the  boldness or impudence or inclination to address you as  you would have liked me to do, weeping and wailing  and lamenting, and saying and doing many things which  you have been accustomed to hear from others, and      // death a penalty ?"
What do I take to  be the explanation of this silence?
"But if death is the journey to another     The hope of immortality    place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what  good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than  this ?"
What would not a man give if he  might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod  and Homer ?
Are these principles to be altered because the  circumstances of Socrates are altered?
Then is his escape con  sistent with the maintenance of them ?
"and if he replies,  'they have injured him/ will not the Laws answer,    'Yes, but was that the agreement ?"
Has he any  objection to make to them which would justify him in  overturning them ?
"Was he not brought into the  world and educated by their help, and are they not    his parents ?"
And whither will he direct his footsteps ?
Will he continue to give lectures in virtue?
"And how will his children  be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly, and deprives   them of Athenian citizenship ?"
"Or if he leaves them  behind, does he expect that they will be better taken  care of by his friends because he is in Thessaly ?"
Socrates Why have you come at this hour?
it must be quite early ?
What is the exact time ?
And are you only just arrived ?
"Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead  of at once awakening me ?"
What ?
"Has the ship come from Delos, on the  arrival of which I am to die ?"
Why do you think so ?
And what was the nature of the vision ?
"Now,  can there be a worse disgrace than this that I should  be thought to value money more than the life of a friend ?"
"But why, my dear Crito, should we care about  the opinion of the many ?"
"Well, I will not dispute with you ; but please to  tell me, Socrates, whether you are not acting out of   regard to me and your other friends : are you not afraid  that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble  with the informers for having stolen you away, and  lose either the whole or a great part of our property ;  or that even a worse evil may happen to us ?"
What will be the fairest way of  considering the question ?
Shall I return to your old  argument about the opinions of men ?
Now were we right in maintaining this before I was  condemned?
And has the argument which was once  good now proved to be talk for the sake of talking  mere childish nonsense?
I ask you whether  I was right in maintaining this ?
"The good are to be regarded, and not the bad ?"
"And the opinions of the wise are good, and the  opinions of the unwise are evil ?"
And what was said about another matter ?
"Is  the pupil who devotes himself to the practice of gym  nastics supposed to attend to the praise and blame and  opinion of every man, or of one man only his physician  or trainer, whoever he may be ?"
"And he ought to fear the censure and welcome  the praise of that one only, and not of the many ?"
"And he ought to act and train, and eat and  drink in the way which seems good to his single master  who has understanding, rather than according to the  opinion of all other men put together ?"
"And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion   and approval of the one, and regards the opinion of the  many who have no understanding, will he not suffer  evil?"
"And what will the evil be, whither tending and  what affecting, in the disobedient person ?"
"Very good ; and is not this true, Crito, of other  things which we need not separately enumerate?"
"In  questions of just and unjust, fair and foul, good and evil,  which are the subjects of our present consultation, ought  we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them ;  or the opinion of the one man who has understanding ?"
ought we not to fear and reverence him more than all  the rest of the world : and if we desert him shall we  not destroy and injure that principle in us which may be  assumed to be improved by justice and deteriorated by  injustice ; there is such a principle ?
"Take a parallel instance : if, acting under the  advice of those who have no understanding, we destroy  that which is improved by health and is deteriorated by  disease, would life be worth having ?"
And that which  has been destroyed is the body?
"Could we live, having an evil and corrupted  body ?"
"And will life be worth having, if that higher     First Principles   part of man be destroyed, which is improved by justice  and depraved by injustice ?"
"Do we suppose that principle,  whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice  and injustice, to be inferior to the body ?"
More honourable than the body ?
"And I  should like to know whether I may say the same of  another proposition that not life, but a good life, is  to be chiefly valued ?"
And a good life is equivalent to a just and  honourable one that holds also ?
"I think that you are right, Socrates ; how then  shall we proceed ?"
"Are we to say that we are never intentionally to  do wrong, or that in one way we ought and in  another way we ought not to do wrong, or is doing  wrong always evil and dishonourable, as I was just now  saying, and as has been already acknowledged by us ?"
Are all our former admissions which were made within   a few days to be thrown away ?
"And have we, at our  age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our  life long only to discover that we are no better than  children ?"
"Or, in spite of the opinion of the many, and  in spite of the consequences whether better or worse,  shall we insist on the truth of what was then said,  that injustice is always an evil and dishonour to him  who acts unjustly ?"
Shall we say so or not ?
Then we must do no wrong ?
"Nor when injured injure in return, as the many  imagine ; for we must injure no one at all?"
"Again, Crito, may we do evil ?"
"And what of doing evil in return for evil, which  is the morality of the many is that just or not ?"
For doing evil to another is thesameasinjuringhim?
And shall  that be the premiss of our argument?
Or do you  decline and dissent from this ?
"Then I will go on to the next point, which may be  put in the form of a question : Ought a man to do what  he admits to be right, or ought he to betray the right ?"
"Soc, But if this is true, what is the application ?"
"In  leaving the prison against the will of the Athenians, do  I wrong any ?"
or rather do I not wrong those whom I  ought least to wrong?
Do I not desert the principles which  were acknowledged by us to be just what do you say ?
What are you about ?
"are you not going by an act of yours to overturn us  the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies ?"
"Do you imagine that a state can subsist and not be  overthrown, in which the decisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by individuals ?"
"What will be our answer, to these  and the like words ?"
Suppose I say that ?
And was that our agreement with you ?
"Tell us, What complaint have you to make against us  which justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the  state?"
In the first place did we not bring you into  existence ?
"Or against those of us who  after birth regulate the nurture and education of children,  in which you also were trained ?"
"Well then, since you were  brought into the world and nurtured and educated by  us, can you deny in the first place that you are our  child and slave, as your fathers were before you ?"
"Would you have any right  to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father  or your master, if you had one, because you have been  struck or reviled by him, or received some other evil  at his hands ?"
you would not say this ?
"And because  we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have   any right to destroy us in return, and your country as  far as in you lies ?"
"Will you, O professor of true virtue,  pretend that you are justified in this ?"
"Has a philosopher  like you failed to discover that our country is more to  be valued and higher and holier far than mother or  father or any ancestor, and more to be regarded in  the eyes of the gods and of men of understanding ?"
"also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated  when angry, even more than a father, and either to be  persuaded, or if not persuaded, to be obeyed ?"
"What answer shall we make  to this, Crito ?"
"Do the laws speak truly, or do they not ?"
"Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody  else ?"
"And first of all answer this very  question : Are we right in saying that you agreed to  be governed according to us in deed, and not in word only ?"
How shall we answer?
Must we not assent ?
"Whereas you, above  all other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state,  or, in other words, of us her laws (and who would care  about a state which has no laws ?"
"For just consider, if you transgress and err in this  sort of way, what good will you do either to yourself  or to your friends ?"
Will you then flee from well-ordered cities and virtuous  men ?
and is existence worth having on these terms ?
"Or will you go to them without shame, and talk to  them, Socrates ?"
And what will you say to them ?
What you say here about virtue and justice and in  stitutions and laws being the best things among men ?
Would that be decent of you ?
"But if  you go away from well-governed states to Crito's  friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and  licence, they will be charmed to hear the tale of your  escape from prison, set off with ludicrous particulars of  the manner in which you were wrapped in a goatskin  or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the  manner is of runaways ; but will there be no one to  remind you that in your old age you were not ashamed  to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire  of a little more life ?"
"Perhaps not, if you keep them  in a good temper ; but if they are out of temper you  will hear many degrading things ; you will live, but  how ?"
"as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of  all men ; and doing what ?"
And where will be your fine sentiments  about justice and virtue ?
Say that you wish to live for the sake of your children you want to bring them  up and educate them will you take them into Thessaly  and deprive them of Athenian citizenship ?
Is this  the benefit which you will confer upon them ?
"Or are  you under the impression that they will be better cared  for and educated here if you are still alive, although  absent from them ; for your friends will take care of  them ?"
"Do you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of  Thessaly they will take care of them, and if you are an  inhabitant of the other world that they will not take care  of them ?"
"Cebes asks why suicide is thought not to be right, if a  death is to be accounted a good ?"
"But why, asks Cebes, if he is a pos  session of the gods, should he wish to die and leave  them ?"
"Enough of them : the real question is,  What is the nature of that death which he desires ?"
Why then should he repine when the hour of separation  arrives ?
"Why, if he is dead while he lives, should he  fear that other death, through which alone he can behold   wisdom in her purity ?"
"When we fear that the soul will vanish away,  let us ask ourselves what is that which we suppose to  be liable to dissolution?"
"Is it the simple or the com  pound, the unchanging or the changing, the invisible  idea or the visible object of sense ?"
"But is not the soul acknowledged  to be a harmony, and has she not the same relation to  the body, as the harmony which like her is invisible  has to the lyre?"
"Again, upon the supposition  that the soul is a harmony, why is one soul better than  another ?"
"Are they more or less harmonized, or is there one harmony within another ?"
Could he have written this under the idea that the soul is a harmony of the body ?
"Nay  rather, are we not contradicting Homer and ourselves  in affirming anything of the sort ?"
For how can one be divided into two ?
or two be compounded  into one?
How shall  they bury him ?
Shall he make a libation of the poison ?
How can the soul be united with the body and still be Independent ?
"Is the soul related to  the body as the ideal to the real, or as the whole to the  parts, or as the subject to the object, or as the cause  to the effect, or as the end to the means?"
"Shall we  say with Aristotle, that the soul is the entelechy or form  of an organized living body ?"
a life of her own ?
"Is the Pythagorean image of the  Harmony, or that of the monad, the truer expression ?"
"Is the soul related to the body as sight to the eye, or  as the boatman to his boat?"
"And in another state of being is the soul  to be conceived of as vanishing into infinity, hardly  possessing an existence which she can call her own,  as in the pantheistic system of Spinoza ?"
"or as an  individual informing another body and entering into  new relations, but retaining her own character ?"
"Or is the opposition of soul  and body a mere illusion, and the true self neither soul nor body, but the union of the two in the 'I' which is above them ?"
"And is death the assertion of this  individuality in the higher nature, and the falling away  into nothingness of the lower?"
Or are we vainly  attempting to pass the boundaries of human thought ?
What is  that which we suppose to be immortal?
"Is it the  personal and individual element in us, or the spiritual  and universal ?"
"Is it the principle of knowledge or of  goodness, or the union of the two ?"
"Is it the mere  force of life which is determined to be, or the con  sciousness of self which cannot be got rid of, or the  fire of genius which refuses to be extinguished ?"
"Or  is there a hidden being which is allied to the Author  of all existence, who is because he is perfect, and to  whom our ideas of perfection give us a title to belong ?"
"Why should the mean, the weak, the  idiot, the infant, the herd of men who have never in  any proper sense the use of reason, reappear with  blinking eyes in the light of another world ?"
Why should the wicked suffer any more than ourselves ?
had we been placed in their circumstances should we  have been any better than they ?
The worst of men  are objects of pity rather than of anger to the philan  thropist ; must they not be equally such to divine  benevolence?
What is  to become of the animals in a future state ?
"Have we  not seen dogs more faithful and intelligent than men,   and men who are more stupid and brutal than any  animals ?"
"Does their life cease at death, or is there  some 'better thing reserved' also for them?"
"We cannot think  of the least or lowest of them, the insect, the bird, the  inhabitants of the sea or the desert, as having any place  in a future world, and if not all, why should those  who are specially attached to man be deemed worthy  of any exceptional privilege ?"
"Philosophers have spoken of them as  forms of the human mind, but what is the mind with  out them ?"
"Do we imagine that the wicked are suffering  torments, or that the good are singing the praises of  God, during a period longer than that of a whole life,  or of ten lives of men ?"
Is the suffering physical or  mental ?
"And does the worship of God consist only  of praise, or of many forms of service ?"
"Who are the  wicked, and who are the good, whom we venture to  divide by a hard and fast line ; and in which of the  two classes should we place ourselves and our friends ?"
"May we not suspect that we are making differences of  kind, because we are unable degree ?"
putting the whole human race into heaven or hell for the greater convenience of logical division ?
"Are we not at the same time superlatives, only that we may satisfy the demands of  rhetoric ?"
What is that pain which does not become  deadened after a thousand years ?
or what is the nature  of that pleasure or happiness which never wearies by  monotony ?
"For are we not imagining heaven under the similitude  of a church, and hell as a prison, or perhaps a mad  house or chamber of horrors ?"
Where  are the actions worthy of rewards greater than those  which are conferred on the greatest benefactors of  mankind ?
"And where are the crimes which according  to Plato's merciful reckoning, more merciful, at any  rate, than the eternal damnation of so-called Christian  teachers, for every ten years in this life deserve  a hundred of punishment in the life to come ?"
May we be allowed  to imagine the minds of men everywhere working to  gether during many ages for the completion of our know  ledge ?
May not the science of physiology transform  the world ?
And are not we at this day seeking to discover  that which Socrates in a glass darkly foresaw ?
Were you in the prison when he drank the poison ?
What  did he say in his last hours ?
Did you not hear of the proceedings at the  trial ?
What was the reason of this ?
What is this ship ?
"What was the manner of his death, Phaedo ?"
What was said or done ?
And which of his friends  were with him ?
Or did the authorities forbid them to  be present so that he had no friends near him when  he died?
"I was pleased, but in the pleasure there was  also a strange admixture of pain ; for I reflected that he  was soon to die, and this double feeling was shared by us  all ; we were laughing and weeping by turns, especially  the excitable Apollodorus, you know the sort of man ?"
Who were present ?
Were there any strangers?
"And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?"
Any one else ?
"Well, and what did you talk about?"
Is death a blessing?
"Why, said Socrates, is not Evenus a philosopher ?"
"Why do you say, enquired Cebes, that a man ought  not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will  be ready to follow the dying ?"
"Socrates replied : And have you, Cebes and Simmias,  who are the disciples of Philolaus, never heard him  speak of this ?"
What can I do  better in the interval between this and the setting of the  sun?
Why is suicide held to be unlawful?
Do you not agree ?
"And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass,  for example, took the liberty of putting himself out of  the way when you had given no intimation of your wish  that he should die, would you not be angry with him,  and would you not punish him if you could ?"
"And yet how can you reconcile this  seemingly true belief that God is our guardian and we  his possessions, with the willingness to die which you  were just now attributing to the philosopher?"
For what can be the meaning of a truly wise  man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?
And so you think that I ought to answer your  indictment as if I were in a court ?
"But do you mean to take away your thoughts with  you, Socrates ?"
Will you not impart them  to us ?
"For I deem that the  true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood  by other men ; they do not perceive that he is always  pursuing death and dying ; and if this be so, and he has  had the desire of death all his life long, why when his  time comes should he repine at that which he has been  always pursuing and desiring ?"
Do we believe  that there is such a thing as death ?
Is it not the separation of soul and body ?
"And  to be dead is the completion of this; when the soul  exists in herself, and is released from the body and  the body is released from the soul, what is this but  death ?"
"There is another question, which will probably throw  light on our present enquiry if you and I can agree  about it: Ought the philosopher to care about the  pleasures if they are to be called pleasures of eating  and drinking?"
And what about the pleasures of love should he  care for them ?
"And will he think much of the other ways of indulging  the body, for example, the acquisition of costly raiment,  or sandals, or other adornments of the body ?"
"Instead  of caring about them, does he not rather despise any  thing more than nature needs ?"
What do you say ?
Would you not say that he is entirely concerned  with the soul and not with the body ?
What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of  knowledge?
"is the body, if invited to share in the  enquiry, a hinderer or a helper ?"
"I mean to say, have  sight and hearing any truth in them ?"
"Are they not,  as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses ?"
"and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what  is to be said of the other senses ?"
for you will allow  that they are the best of them ?
Then when does the soul attain truth ?
The sensible is not the real?
"Then must not true existence be revealed to her in  thought, if at all ?"
"And thought is best when the mind is gathered into  herself and none of these things trouble her neither  sounds nor sights nor pain nor any pleasure, when she  takes leave of the body, and has as little as possible to do  with it, when she has no bodily sense or desire, but  is aspiring after true being ?"
And in this the philosopher dishonours the body ;  his soul runs away from his body and desires to be  alone and by herself?
"Well, but there is another thing, Simmias : Is there  or is there not an absolute justice ?"
And an absolute beauty and absolute good ?
But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes ?
Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily  sense ?
Has the reality of them  ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs ?
"or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge  of their several natures made by him who so orders his  intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception  of the essence of each thing which he considers ?"
"And he attains to the purest knowledge of them who  goes to each with the mind alone, not introducing or  intruding in the act of thought sight or any other sense   together with reason, but with the very light of the mind  in her own clearness searches into the very truth of each ;  he who has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears  and, so to speak, of the whole body, these being in his  opinion distracting elements which when they infect  the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge  who, if not he, is likely to attain to the knowledge  of true being ?"
"And when real philosophers consider all these things,  will they not be led to make a reflection which they  will express in words something like the following?"
"Have we not found,' they will say, ' a path of thought  which seems to bring us and our argument to the  conclusion, that while we are in the body, and while  the soul is infected with the evils of the body, our  desire will not be satisfied ?"
"Whence come wars, and  fightings, and factions ?"
whence but from the body and the lusts of the body ?
You would agree ; would you not ?
"And what is purification but the separation of the  soul from the body, as I was saying before ; the habit  of the soul gathering and collecting herself into herself  from all sides out of the body ; the dwelling in her  own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as  far as she can ; the release of the soul from the  chains of the body ?"
And this separation and release of the soul from the  body is termed death ?
Is not the separation and  release of the soul from the body their especial study ?
"And will  he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is strongly  persuaded in like manner that only in the world below  he can worthily enjoy her, still repine at death ?"
Will  he not depart with joy ?
"And when you see a man who is repining at the ap  proach of death, is not his reluctance a sufficient proof  that he is not a lover of wisdom, but a lover of the  body, and probably at the same time a lover of either  money or power, or both ?"
" The true philosopher   And is not courage, Simmias, a quality which is  specially characteristic of the philosopher ?"
"There is temperance again, which even by the vulgar  is supposed to consist in the control and regulation of  the passions, and in the sense of superiority to them  is not temperance a virtue belonging to those only who  despise the body, and who pass their lives in philosophy ?"
How so?
And do not courageous men face death because they  are afraid of yet greater evils ?
And are not the temperate exactly in the same case ?
"O my blessed Simmias, is there not one true  coin for which all things ought to be exchanged ?"
"And is not  all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what  fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or  may not attend her ?"
Shall I suggest  that we converse a little of the probabilities of these  things ?
"Now if it be true that the living come from the dead,  then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not,  how could they have been born again ?"
Are not  all things which have opposites generated out of their  opposites ?
And is this true of all opposites ?
and are we con  vinced that all of them are generated out of opposites ?
"And in this universal opposition of all things, are  there not also two intermediate processes which are  ever going on, from one to the other opposite, and back  again ; where there is a greater and a less there is also  an intermediate process of increase and diminution,  and that which grows is said to wax, and that which  decays to wane ?"
"And this necessarily holds of all opposites, even  though not always expressed in words they are really     The alternation of sleep and waking   generated out of one another, and there is a passing  or process from one to the other of them ?"
"Well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep  is the opposite of waking ?"
And what is it ?
"And these, if they are opposites, are generated the  one from the other, and have their two intermediate  processes also ?"
Do you agree ?
Is not death opposed to life?
And they are generated one from the other?
What is generated from the living ?
And what from the dead ?
"Then the living, whether things or persons, Cebes,  are generated from the dead ?"
Then the inference is that our souls exist in the  world below ?
And one of the two processes or generations is  visible for surely the act of dying is visible ?
What then is to be the result?
Shall we exclude  the opposite process ?
and shall we suppose nature  to walk on one leg only ?
Must we not rather assign  to death some corresponding process of generation ?
And what is that process ?
"And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the  a birth of the dead into the world of the living ?"
"And in like manner, my dear Cebes, if all  things which partook of life were to die, and after  they were dead remained in the form of death, and  did not come to life again, all would at last die, and  nothing would be alive what other result could there  be?"
"For if the living spring from any other things,  and they too die, must not all things at last be swal  lowed up in death ?"
"If you put a question to a person in a right  way, he will give a true answer of himself, but how could  he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason  already in him ?"
"But if, said Socrates, you are still incredulous,  Simmias, I would ask you whether you may not agree  with me when you look at the matter in another way;  I mean, if you are still incredulous as to whether  knowledge is recollection?"
"And what is the nature of this knowledge or recol  lection I I mean to ask, Whether a person who, having  seen or heard or in any way perceived anything, knows  not only that, but has a conception of something else  which is the subject, not of the same but of some other  kind of knowledge, may not be fairly said to recollect  that of which he has the conception ?"
What do you mean ?
I mean what I may illustrate by the following  instance : The knowledge of a lyre is not the same as  the knowledge of a man ?
"And yet what is die feeling of lovers when they  recognize a lyre, or a garment, or anything else which  the beloved has been in the habit of using ?"
"Do not  they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye  an image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs ?"
Well ; and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse or a lyre remember a man ?
"and from the  picture of Simmias, you may be led to remember Cebes ?"
Or you may also be led to the recollection of Simmias  himself ?
"And in all these cases, the recollection may be  derived from things either like or unlike ?"
"And when the recollection is derived from like  things, then another consideration is sure to arise,  which is whether the likeness in any degree falls  short or not of that which is recollected ?"
"And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that  there is such a thing as equality, not of one piece  of wood or stone with another, but that, over and above  this, there is absolute equality ?"
Shall we say so ?
And do we know the nature of this absolute essence ?
And whence did we obtain our knowledge ?
"Did  we not see equalities of material things, such as pieces  of wood and stones, and gather from them the idea  of an equality which is different from them ?"
"Or look  at the matter in another way : Do not the same pieces  of wood or stone appear at one time equal, and at  another time unequal ?"
But are real equals ever unequal ?
or is the idea of  equality the same as of inequality ?
Then these (so-called) equals are not the same with  the idea of equality ?
"And yet from these equals, although differing from  the idea of equality, you conceived and attained that idea ?"
"Which might be like, or might be unlike them ?"
"But that makes no difference : whenever from seeing  one thing you conceived another, whether like or unlike,  there must surely have been an act of recollection ?"
"But what would you say of equal portions of wood  and stone, or other material equals ?"
and what is the  impression produced by them ?
Are they equals in the  same sense in which absolute equality is equal ?
or do  they fall short of this perfect equality in a measure ?
"And must we not allow, that when I or any one,  looking at any object, observes that the thing which he  sees aims at being some other thing, but falls short  of, and cannot be, that other thing, but is inferior,  he who makes this observation must have had a previous  knowledge of that to which the other, although similar,  was inferior?"
And has not this been our own case in the matter of  equals and of absolute equality ?
"Then we must have known equality previously to  the time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals strive to attain  absolute equality, but fall short of it ?"
"And we recognize also that this absolute equality  has only been known, and can only be known, through  the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the  senses, which are all alike in this respect ?"
From the senses then is derived the knowledge that  all sensible things aim at an absolute equality of which  they fall short ?
"Then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any  way, we must have had a knowledge of absolute equality,  or we could not have referred to that standard the equals  which are derived from the senses ?"
And did we not see and hear and have the use of  our other senses as soon as we were born ?
"That is to say, before we were born, I suppose ?"
Of all this we may certainly affirm  that we acquired the knowledge before birth ?
"Is not forgetting, Simmias, just the losing of  knowledge ?"
"But if the knowledge which we acquired before birth  was lost by us at birth, and if afterwards by the use of  the senses we recovered what we previously knew, will  not the process which we call learning be a recovering  of the knowledge which is natural to us, and may not  this be rightly termed recollection ?"
"And which alternative, Simmias, do you prefer?"
"Had we the knowledge at our birth, or did we  recollect the things which we knew previously to our  birth ?"
At any rate you can decide whether he who has  knowledge will or will not be able to render an account  of his knowledge ?
What do you say ?
But do you think that every man is able to give an  account of these very matters about which we are  speaking ?
"Then you are not of opinion, Simmias, that all men  know these things ?"
They are in process of recollecting that which they  learned before ?
But when did our souls acquire this knowledge ?
not since we were born as men ?
"And therefore, previously ?"
"Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them ?"
"Do we lose them at the moment of receiv  ing them, or if not at what other time ?"
"Then may we not say that if, as we are always repeating, there is an absolute beauty, and  goodness, and an absolute essence of all things ; and if  to this, which is now discovered to have existed in our  former state, we refer all our sensations, and with this  compare them, finding these ideas to be pre-existent  and our inborn possession then our souls must have  had a prior existence, but if not, there would be no  force in the argument ?"
 But what proves immortality ?
"Well, but is Cebes equally satisfied?"
"For admitting  that she may have been born elsewhere, and framed  out of other elements, and was in existence before  entering the human body, why after having entered  in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed  and come to an end ?"
"For if the soul exists before birth, and in coming to  life and being born can be born only from death and  dying, must she not after death continue to exist, since  she has to be born again ?"
"And where shall we find a good charmer of our g  fears, Socrates, when you are gone ?"
"By all means, replied Socrates ; what else should I  please ?"
"Must we not, said Socrates, ask ourselves what that  is which, as we imagine, is liable to be scattered, and  about which we fear ?"
and what again is that about  which we have no fear ?
"Is that idea or essence, which in the dialectical process  we define as essence or true existence whether essence  of equality, beauty, or anything else are these essences,  I say, liable at times to some degree of change ?"
"or are  they each of them always what they are, having the  same simple self-existent and unchanging forms, not  admitting of variation at all, or in any way, or at any  time ?"
"And what would you say of the many beautiful  whether men or horses or garments or any other things  which are named by the same names and may be called  equal or beautiful, are they all unchanging and the  same always, or quite the reverse ?"
"May they not  rather be described as almost always changing and  hardly ever the same, either with themselves or with  one another?"
"And these you can touch and see and perceive with  the senses, but the unchanging things you can only per  ceive with the mind they are invisible and are not seen ?"
"The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the un  changing ?"
"And, further, is not one part of us body, another  part soul ?"
And to which class is the body more alike and akin ?
And is the soul seen or not seen ?
And what we mean by 'seen' and 'not seen' is  that which is or is not visible to the eye of man ?
And is the soul seen or not seen ?
Unseen then ?
"Then the soul is more like to the unseen, and the  body to the seen ?"
"And were we not saying long ago that the soul  when using the body as an instrument of perception,  that is to say, when using the sense of sight or hearing  or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving  through the body is perceiving through the senses)  were we not saying that the soul too is then dragged  by the body into the region of the changeable, and  wanders and is confused ; the world spins round her,  and she is like a drunkard, when she touches change ?"
And this state of  the soul is called wisdom ?
"And to which class is the soul more nearly alike and  akin, as far as may be inferred from this argument, as  well as from the preceding one ?"
And the body is more like the changing ?
Now which of these two functions  is akin to the divine ?
and which to the mortal ?
"Does  not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally  orders and rules, and the mortal to be that which is  subject and servant ?"
And which does the soul resemble ?
"Then reflect, Cebes : of all which has been said is  not this the conclusion ?"
"Can this, my dear Cebes, be denied ?"
"But if it be true, then is not the body liable to speedy  dissolution ?"
and is not the soul almost or altogether in  dissoluble ?
"And do you further observe, that after a man is  dead, the body, or visible part of him, which is lying in  the visible world, and is called a corpse, and would  naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated, is  not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for  some time, nay even for a long time, if the constitution  be sound at the time of death, and the season of the  year favourable ?"
"For the body when shrunk and embalmed, as the manner is in Egypt, may remain almost  entire through infinite ages ; and even in decay, there  are still some portions, such as the bones and ligaments,  which are practically indestructible : Do you agree?"
"And is it likely that the soul, which is invisible, in  passing to the place of the true Hades, which like her  is invisible, and pure, and noble, and on her way to the  good and wise God, whither, if God will, my soul is  also soon to go, that the soul, I repeat, if this be her  nature and origin, will be blown away and destroyed  immediately on quitting the body, as the many say ?"
"The  truth rather is, that the soul which is pure at departing  and draws after her no bodily taint, having never volun  tarily during life had connection with the body, which  she is ever avoiding, herself gathered into herself ; and  making such abstraction her perpetual study which  means that she has been a true disciple of philosophy ;   and therefore has in fact been always engaged in the  practice of dying ?"
For is not philosophy the study of i  death ?
"Is not this true, Cebes ?"
"But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure  at the time of her departure, and is the companion and  servant of the body always, and is in love with and  fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures  of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth  only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch  and see and taste, and use for the purposes of his lusts,  the soul, I mean, accustomed to hate and fear and  avoid the intellectual principle, which to the bodily eye  is dark and invisible, and can be attained only by philosophy ; do you suppose that such a soul will depart  pure and unalloyed ?"
"What natures do you mean, Socrates ?"
What do you think ?
"And those who have chosen the portion of injustice,  and tyranny, and violence, will pass into wolves, or  into hawks and kites ; whither else can we suppose  them to go ?"
"And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to  all of them places answering to their several natures  and propensities ?"
Why are they the happiest ?
"What do you mean, Socrates ?"
"What is it, Socrates ?"
And is not this the state in which the soul is most  enthralled by the body ?
How so ?
"And Socrates observing them asked what  they thought of the argument, and whether there was  anything wanting ?"
"O Simmias, what are  you saying ?"
Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of  prophecy in me as the swans ?
"In this respect, replied Simmias : Suppose a person  to use the same argument about harmony and the lyre  might he not say that harmony is a thing invisible,  incorporeal, perfect, divine, existing in the lyre which  is harmonized, but that the lyre and the strings are           The soul the harmony of the body     matter and material, composite, earthy, and akin to  mortality ?"
"And if any one maintains that the soul, being  the harmony of the elements of the body, is first to  perish in that which is called death, how shall we  answer him ?"
"Socrates looked fixedly at us as his manner was, and  said with a smile : Simmias has reason on his side ; and  why does not some one of you who is better able than   myself answer him?"
"Please to tell me then, Cebes, he said, what was the  difficulty which troubled you ?"
"Well then, says the argument to me, why do you  remain unconvinced ?"
"When you see that the weaker  continues in existence after the man is dead, will you  not admit that the more lasting must also survive during  the same period of time?"
"The  analogy which I will adduce is that of an old weaver,  who dies, and after his death somebody says : He is  not dead, he must be alive; see, there is the coat  which he himself wove and wore, and which remains      May not the soul wear out?"
"There I feel with you by heaven I do,  Phaedo, and when you were speaking, I was beginning  to ask myself the same question : What argument can I  ever trust again ?"
"For what could be more convincing  than the argument of Socrates, which has now fallen  into discredit ?"
"Tell me,  I implore you, how did Socrates proceed ?"
Did he  appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you men  tion ?
or did he calmly meet the attack ?
And did he  answer forcibly or feebly?
What followed?
What shall I do with them ?
Of what nature ?
You must have observed this trait  of character ?
And is not the feeling discreditable?
What do you mean ?
Did you never observe this ?
"And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were  a competition in evil, the worst would be found to be  very few?"
"Are not these,  Simmias and Cebes, the points which we have to consider ?"
"He proceeded : And did you deny the force of the  whole preceding argument, or of a part only ?"
"And what did you think, he said, of that part of the  argument in which we said that knowledge was re  collection, and hence inferred that the soul must have  previously existed somewhere else before she was enclosed in the body ?"
"But do you not see that this is what you imply when  you say that the soul existed before she took the form  and body of man, and was made up of elements which  as yet had no existence ?"
And how  can such a notion of the soul as this agree with the other ?
"And yet, he said, there surely ought to be harmony  in a discourse of which harmony is the theme ?"
Which of them will you retain ?
"Let me put the matter, Simmias, he said, in another  point of view : Do you imagine that a harmony or any  other composition can be in a state other than that of   the elements, out of which it is compounded ?"
And does not the nature of every harmony depend  upon the manner in which the elements are harmonized ?
But does the soul admit of degrees ?
"or is one soul  in the very least degree more or less, or more or less  completely, a soul than another?"
"Yet surely of two souls, one is said to have intel  ligence and virtue, and to be good, and the other to  have folly and vice, and to be an evil soul : and this is  said truly ?"
But what will those who maintain the soul to be a  harmony say of this presence of virtue and vice in the  soul ?
"will they say that here is another harmony, and  another discord, and that the virtuous soul is harmonized,  and herself being a harmony has another harmony within  her, and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has  no harmony within her ?"
"And we have already admitted that no soul is more  a soul than another ; which is equivalent to admitting  that harmony is not more or less harmony, or more or  less completely a harmony ?"
And that which is not more or less a harmony is not  more or less harmonized ?
"And that which is not more or less harmonized can  not have more or less of harmony, but only an equal  harmony ?"
"Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a  soul than another, is not more or less harmonized ?"
"And therefore has neither more nor less of discord,  nor yet of harmony ?"
"And having neither more nor less of harmony or of  discord, one soul has no more vice or virtue than  another, if vice be discord and virtue harmony ?"
And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has  no vice?
"How can she have, if the previous argument holds?"
"Then, if all souls are equally by their nature souls,  all souls of all living creatures will be equally good ?"
"And can all this be true, think you ?"
he said ; for  these are the consequences which seem to follow from  the assumption that the soul is a harmony ?
"Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the ele  ments of human nature other than the soul, and es  pecially the wise soul ?"
Do you know of any ?
And is the soul in agreement with the affections of  the body ?
or is she at variance with them ?
"For example, when the body is hot and thirsty, does not the soul incline us against drinking ?"
"and when the body is  hungry, against eating ?"
"But we have already acknowledged that the soul,  being a harmony, can never utter a note at variance with  the tensions and relaxations and vibrations and other  affections of the strings out of which she is composed ;  she can only follow, she cannot lead them ?"
"Do you think that Homer wrote this under the idea  that the soul is a harmony capable of being led by the  affections of the body, and not rather of a nature which  should lead and master them herself a far diviner  thing than any harmony ?"
"Thus much, said Socrates, of Harmonia, your The-  ban goddess, who has graciously yielded to us ; but  what shall I say, Cebes, to her husband Cadmus, and  how shall I make peace with him ?"
"When I was  young, Cebes, I had a prodigious desire to know that  department of philosophy which is called the investigation of nature ; to know the causes of things, and why  a thing is and is created or destroyed appeared to me to  be a lofty profession ; and I was always agitating my  self with the consideration of questions such as these :  Is the growth of animals the result of some decay  which the hot and cold principle contracts, as some  have said ?"
"Is the blood the element with which we  think, or the air, or the fire ?"
Was not that a reasonable notion ?
And what is now your notion of such matters ?
"I should be far enough from imagining, he replied,  that I knew the cause of any of them, by heaven I should;  for I cannot satisfy myself that, when one is added to  ?"
Do you  agree in this notion of the cause ?
Do you not agree with me ?
"You would be afraid to  draw such an inference, would you not ?"
"In like manner you would be afraid to say that ten  exceeded eight by, and by reason of, two ; but would  say by, and by reason of, number ; or you would say  that two cubits exceed one cubit not by a half, but by  magnitude ?"
"Again, would you not be cautious of affirming that  the addition of one to one, or the division of one, is the  cause of two ?"
But  what followed ?
"After all this had been admitted, and they  had agreed that ideas exist, and that other things par  ticipate in them and derive their names from them,  Socrates, if I remember rightly, said :   This is your way of speaking; and yet when you  say that Simmias is greater than Socrates and less than  Phaedo, do you not predicate of Simmias both greatness  and smallness ?"
"But still you allow that Simmias does not really exceed Socrates, as the words may seem to imply, because  he is Simmias, but by reason of the size which he has ;  just as Simmias does not exceed Socrates because he is  Simmias, any more than because Socrates is Socrates,  but because he has smallness when compared with the  greatness of Simmias ?"
"And if Phaedo exceeds him in size, this is not because  Phaedo is Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness  relatively to Simmias, who is comparatively smaller ?"
"At the  same time, turning to Cebes, he said : Are you at all  disconcerted, Cebes, at our friend's objection ?"
"Then we are agreed after all, said Socrates, that the  opposite will never in any case be opposed to itself?"
"Yet once more let me ask you to consider the ques  tion from another point of view, and see whether you  agree with me : There is a thing which you term heat,  and another thing which you term cold ?"
But are they the same as fire and snow ?
"Heat is a thing different from fire, and cold is not  the same with snow ?"
"And yet you will surely admit, that when snow, as  was before said, is under the influence of heat, they will  not remain snow and heat; but at the advance of the  heat, the snow will either retire or perish ?"
Does this ever apply to the concrete?
I will try  to make this clearer by an example : The odd number  is always called by the name of odd ?
But is this the only thing which is called odd ?
"Are  there not other things which have their own name, and   yet are called odd, because, although not the same as  oddness, they are never without oddness ?"
"And there are many  other examples : would you not say, for example, that  three may be called by its proper name, and also be  called odd, which is not the same with three ?"
Do you agree ?
"For example: Will not the number  three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be  converted into an even number, while remaining three ?"
"And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not  opposed to the number three ?"
"Are they not, Cebes, such as compel the things of  which they have possession, not only to take their own  form, but also the form of some opposite ?"
What do you mean ?
"And on this oddness, of which the number three has  the impress, the opposite idea will never intrude ?"
And this impress was given by the odd principle ?
And to the odd is opposed the even ?
Then the idea of the even number will never arrive  at three ?
Then three has no part in the even ?
Then the triad or number three is uneven ?
"Nor again will parts in the ratio  : , nor any  fraction in which there is a half, nor again in which there  is a third, admit the notion of the whole, although they  are not opposed to the whole : You will agree ?"
"Tell me, then, what is that of which the inherence  will render the body alive ?"
And is this always the case ?
"Then whatever the soul possesses, to that she comes  bearing life ?"
And is there any opposite to life ?
And what is that ?
"And now, he said, what did we just now call that  principle which repels the even ?"
And that principle which repels the musical or the  just ?
And what do we call that principle which does not  admit of death ?
And does the soul admit of death ?
Then the soul is immortal ?
And may we say that this has been proven ?
"Supposing that the odd were imperishable, must not three be imperishable ?"
"And if that which is cold were imperishable, when  the warm principle came attacking the snow, must not  the snow have retired whole and un melted for it could  never have perished, nor could it have remained and  admitted the heat ?"
What then is death?
"Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were im  perishable, the fire when assailed by cold would not  have perished or have been extinguished, but would  have gone away unaffected ?"
"Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must  not the soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable ?"
"Then when death attacks a man, the mortal portion  of him may be supposed to die, but the immortal retires  at the approach of death and is preserved safe and  sound ?"
"What do you mean, Socrates ?"
"And the reason why the streams are always  flowing in and out, is that the watery element has no  bed or bottom, but is swinging and surging up and     The regions of love ?"
"Wherefore, Simmias, seeing all these things, what  ought not we to do that we may obtain virtue and  wisdom in this life?"
"When he had done speaking, Crito said : And have  you any commands for us, Socrates anything to say  about your children, or any other matter in which we  can serve you?"
"We will do our best, said Crito : And in what way  shall we bury you ?"
"Then he turned to us, and added with a smile: I  cannot make Crito believe that I am the same Socrates  who have been talking and conducting the argument ;  he fancies that I am the other Socrates whom he will  soon see, a dead body and he asks, How shall he  bury me ?"
"At the same time he  handed the cup to Socrates, who in the easiest and gen  tlest manner, without the least fear or change of colour  or feature, looking at the man with all his eyes, Eche-  crates, as his manner was, took the cup and said : What  do you say about making a libation out of this cup to  any god ?"
"May I, or not ?"
Socrates alone retained his  calmness : What is this strange outcry ?
"He was beginning to grow cold about the groin, when  he uncovered his face, for he had covered himself up,  and said they were his last words he said : Crito, I  owe a cock to Asclepius ; will you remember to pay the  debt ?"
"The debt shall be paid, said Crito ; is there  anything else ?"
May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows?
"Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?"
"In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action?"
"In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird?"
"While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge?"
What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace?
And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions?
"What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me?"
. Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)?
Who can secure the condition of rest?
"But mark their issues, good and ill;--  What space the gulf between shall fill?"
Who can of Tao the nature tell?
How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things?
To whom is it that these (two) things are owing?
How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom?
Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity?
"Or fame or life,  Which do you hold more dear?"
"Or life or wealth,  To which would you adhere?"
Keep life and lose those other things;  Keep them and lose your life:--which brings  Sorrow and pain more near?
And for what reason?
And for what reason?
How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky?
How do I know that it is so?
Who knows what either will come to in the end?
Shall we then dispense with correction?
Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much?
"Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it?"
"But   When Heaven's anger smites a man,  Who the cause shall truly scan?"
The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death?
"If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong?"
May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow?
. Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven?
And how can this be beneficial (to the other)?

"As I Ponder’d in Silence   As I ponder’d in silence,   Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,   A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,   Terrible in beauty, age, and power,   The genius of poets of old lands,   As to me directing like flame its eyes,   With finger pointing to many immortal songs,   And menacing voice, What singest thou?"

"When I Read the Book   When I read the book, the biography famous,   And is this then (said I) what the author calls a man’s life?"
And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?
"We have watch’d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,   And have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the       seasons, and effuse as much?"
What Place Is Besieged?
"What place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?"
"To You   Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why       should you not speak to me?"
And why should I not speak to you?
In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?
"I will sing the song of companionship,   I will show what alone must finally compact these,   I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,       indicating it in me,   I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were       threatening to consume me,   I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,   I will give them complete abandonment,   I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,   For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy?"
And who but I should be the poet of comrades?
"I too, following many and follow’d by many, inaugurate a religion, I       descend into the arena,   (It may be I am destin’d to utter the loudest cries there, the       winner’s pealing shouts,   Who knows?"
   What are you doing young man?
"Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours?"
"These ostensible realities, politics, points?"
Your ambition or business whatever it may be?
   What do you seek so pensive and silent?
What do you need camerado?
Dear son do you think it is love?
   Was somebody asking to see the soul?
All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;   How can the real body ever die and be buried?
Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?
Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?
"For your life adhere to me,   (I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give       myself really to you, but what of that?"
Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much?
have you reckon’d the earth much?
Have you practis’d so long to learn to read?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?
"I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;   As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night,       and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,   Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with       their plenty,   Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,   That they turn from gazing after and down the road,   And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,   Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?"
   A child said What is the grass?
fetching it to me with full hands;   How could I answer the child?
"Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,   A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,   Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see       and remark, and say Whose?"
What do you think has become of the young and old men?
And what do you think has become of the women and children?
   Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
Which of the young men does she like the best?
"Where are you off to, lady?"
"Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what       is that you express in your eyes?"
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish?
does the early redstart twittering       through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?
   Who goes there?
"hankering, gross, mystical, nude;   How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?"
What is a man anyhow?
what am I?
what are you?
Why should I pray?
why should I venerate and be ceremonious?
Have you outstript the rest?
are you the President?
What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?
"Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,   It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,   Walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?"
"Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of       articulation,   Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?"
"   To be in any form, what is that?"
   Is this then a touch?
what are you doing?
"Did it make you ache so, leaving me?"
"I wonder where they get those tokens,   Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?"
"I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,   Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?"
   Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
"Our frigate takes fire,   The other asks if we demand quarter?"
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
"   The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?"
"Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?"
Is he some Southwesterner rais’d out-doors?
is he Kanadian?
Is he from the Mississippi country?
"Iowa, Oregon, California?"
The mountains?
"prairie-life, bush-life?"
or sailor from the sea?
"you seem to look for something at my hands,   Say, old top-knot, what do you want?"
"I heard what was said of the universe,   Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;   It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?"
"Not words of routine this song of mine,   But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;   This printed and bound book—but the printer and the       printing-office boy?"
The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid       in your arms?
"The black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but       the pluck of the captain and engineers?"
"In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and       hostess, and the look out of their eyes?"
"The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?"
The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?
"Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,   And what is reason?"
and what is love?
and what is life?
The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?
"Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?"
"This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,   And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs,       and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we       be fill’d and satisfied then?"
"I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?"
Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
"I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,   O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and promotions,   If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?"
Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
what have you to confide to me?
Do I contradict myself?
Who has done his day’s work?
who will soonest be through with his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?
Will you speak before I am gone?
will you prove already too late?
what is it to us what the rest do or think?
What is all else to us?
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?
"And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?"
"   I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,   To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,   To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,   To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly       round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?"
"The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred,   No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the       laborers’ gang?"
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?
"Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has       no right to a sight?"
"Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and       the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,   For you only, and not for him and her?"
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring       through the centuries?
Have you ever loved the body of a woman?
Have you ever loved the body of a man?
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations       and times all over the earth?
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body?
or the fool       that corrupted her own live body?
(What is this that frees me so in storms?
why do you tantalize me thus?
O why sting me for a swift moment only?
Why can you not continue?
O why do you now cease?
Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would       soon certainly kill me?
I Am He That Aches with Love   I am he that aches with amorous love;   Does the earth gravitate?
"does not all matter, aching, attract all matter?"
"Native Moments   Native moments—when you come upon me—ah you are here now,   Give me now libidinous joys only,   Give me the drench of my passions, give me life coarse and rank,   To-day I go consort with Nature’s darlings, to-night too,   I am for those who believe in loose delights, I share the midnight       orgies of young men,   I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers,   The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low person       for my dearest friend,   He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate, he shall be one condemn’d by       others for deeds done,   I will play a part no longer, why should I exile myself from my companions?"
"Facing West from California’s Shores   Facing west from California’s shores,   Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,   I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,       the land of migrations, look afar,   Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;   For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,   From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,   From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,   Long having wander’d since, round the earth having wander’d,   Now I face home again, very pleas’d and joyous,   (But where is what I started for so long ago?"
Who is he that would become my follower?
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?
"These I Singing in Spring   These I singing in spring collect for lovers,   (For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy?"
Are You the New Person Drawn Toward Me?
Are you the new person drawn toward me?
"To begin with take warning, I am surely far different from what you suppose;   Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?"
Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?
Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy’d satisfaction?
Do you think I am trusty and faithful?
"Do you see no further than this facade, this smooth and tolerant       manner of me?"
Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man?
"Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya, illusion?"
"Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes   Not heat flames up and consumes,   Not sea-waves hurry in and out,   Not the air delicious and dry, the air of ripe summer, bears lightly       along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,   Waited, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;   Not these, O none of these more than the flames of me, consuming,       burning for his love whom I love,   O none more than I hurrying in and out;   Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up?"
"I Hear It Was Charged Against Me   I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions,   But really I am neither for nor against institutions,   (What indeed have I in common with them?"
"The Prairie-Grass Dividing   The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing,   I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,   Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,   Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,   Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,   Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and       command, leading not following,   Those with a never-quell’d audacity, those with sweet and lusty       flesh clear of taint,   Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors,       as to say Who are you?"
What Think You I Take My Pen in Hand?
What think you I take my pen in hand to record?
"The battle-ship, perfect-model’d, majestic, that I saw pass the       offing to-day under full sail?"
The splendors of the past day?
or the splendor of the night that       envelops me?
Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?
"To a Western Boy   Many things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine;   Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins,   If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers,   Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine?"
What widens within you Walt Whitman?
What waves and soils exuding?
What climes?
what persons and cities are here?
"Who are the infants, some playing, some slumbering?"
Who are the girls?
who are the married women?
Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about       each other’s necks?
What rivers are these?
what forests and fruits are these?
What are the mountains call’d that rise so high in the mists?
What myriads of dwellings are they fill’d with dwellers?
   What do you hear Walt Whitman?
   What do you see Walt Whitman?
"Who are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?"
"O highway I travel, do you say to me Do not leave me?"
Do you say Venture not—if you leave me you are lost?
"Do you say I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied,       adhere to me?"
Only the kernel of every object nourishes;   Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?
Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?
"Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos;   Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?"
Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?
"   Here is the efflux of the soul,   The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates,       ever provoking questions,   These yearnings why are they?"
these thoughts in the darkness why are they?
Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight       expands my blood?
Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?
Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious       thoughts descend upon me?
(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always       drop fruit as I pass;)   What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?
What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?
What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by       and pause?
What gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will?
what       gives them to be free to mine?
Have the past struggles succeeded?
What has succeeded?
yourself?
your nation?
Nature?
"I give you my love more precious than money,   I give you myself before preaching or law;   Will you give me yourself?"
will you come travel with me?
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?
   What is it then between us?
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
"   It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,   The dark threw its patches down upon me also,   The best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious,   My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?"
Who was to know what should come home to me?
Who knows but I am enjoying this?
"Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you       now, for all you cannot see me?"
"   Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than       mast-hemm’d Manhattan?"
River and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide?
"The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the       twilight, and the belated lighter?"
"What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I       love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?"
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that       looks in my face?
"Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?"
We understand then do we not?
"What I promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted?"
"What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not       accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not?"
"A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,   How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?"
