Foreword

Boundless wind and moon-the eye within eyes,
Inexhaustible heaven and earth-the light beyond light,
The

willow dark.

the

flower bright-ten thousand

houses;
Knock at any door-there's one who will respond.
This verse is known as the Preface to The Blue Cliff Record.
Although the name of the book is taken from the place where it
was written, all heaven and earth is nothing but the mass of
this Blue Cliff. The hundred cases selected by Hsueh Tou for
The Blue Cliff Record are as ten thousand and eighty-four
thousand, which are the numbers of dharmas expounded by
Shakyamuni Buddha. The innumerable dharmas revealed by
him are to be found in each case of The Blue Cliff Record.
There are numerous ways to read a book: skimming,
memorizing, careful study, quiet reading, reading aloud, read­
ing with the body, reading with the mind, and reality-reading.
It is this last kind of reading which The Blue Cliff Record
requires. In this mode, you yourself become the case, and in so
doing, the Blue Cliff of ancient China stands revealed as your
very life, right here in this time and place.
Since the translators have alreadv ahlv discussed the form
and compilation of the book in their introduction, it is unneces­
sary for me to cover the same ground. But I should like to
mention one thing: that the first person to introduce this text
to Japan was Kigen Dagen Zenji, founder of the Soto School of
Japanese Zen. In 1227, at age 26, Dagen Zenji had completed
five years of study in China and was preparing for his return to
Japan. But shortly before leaving, he discovered a copy of The
Blue Cliff Record, and was so impressed that he spent his en­
tire last night in China sitting up and hand-copying it. The
hand-copied manuscript, known as the Ichiya Hekigan or
"One-Night Blue Cliff Record," is now treasured and housed at
Daijoji Monastery in Japan.
As mentioned in the Introduction, around 1140 Ta Hui
xi

xii

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

burned the original, published by his teacher Yuan Wu in 1128.
The familiar version of the present day is the edition of 1300,
based upon remaining handwritten copies and two previously
published versions. The manuscript Dagen Zenji brought back
to Japan some seventy years earlier was probably based on one
of the two previous versions, or on a handwritten copy of the
day.

The Blue Cliff Record has become almost uniquely revered
among Zen Buddhists as a model koan text, especially noted
for its subtlety and profundity in both form and content. In­
terestingly enough, another koan collection, the Book of
Equanimity

(J.: Sh6y6 Roku) parallels it in form and level of

sophistication. Unlike The Blue Cliff Record, which was com­
piled and refined by masters of the Rinzai and Ummon
Schools, the Book of Equanimity is a product of the Soto
lineage, and is primarily associated with that school. Nonethe­
less, The Blue Cliff Record appears to have been widely ap­
preciated by Soto masters, although the Book of Equanimity
failed to gain much prominence among teachers of the Rinzai
School.
It is noteworthy that Dagen Zenji selected twenty-four cases
from The Blue Cliff Record, nearly a fourth of the total number
of cases, for inclusion in his own three-hundred-case collection
of koans entitled the Shinji Shobogenzo ("The Shobogenzo in
Chinese"). This is not to be confused with the Kaji
Shobogenzo {"The Shobogenzo in Japanese"), which most
modern readers think of when they mention the Shobogenz6.
This latter work is heavily based upon koan interpretations
and commentaries by Dagen Zenji.
We mention this because of an unfortunately widespread
impression nowadays that Dagen Zenji and the Soto School
represent a non-koan or even anti-koan orientation within
Zen. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Like Ta
Hui of the Lin Chi School, Dagen Zenji was critical of the
abuses of koan study common in his day. These abuses, which
essentially involved a stereotyped and overly intellectual use
of koans, led Dagen Zenji to express his concern lest the clarity
and vigor of Zen students fall into deeper decline. Similarly, Ta
Hui's burning of The Blue Cliff Record was an expression of his
concern over the misuse of koans, rather than any fundamental
objection to the use of koans, verses, or commentaries as such.

Foreword

xiii

Avoiding sectarian prejudice, misunderstanding, or biased
views of koans, I sincerely wish that The Blue Cliff Record, one
of the most wonderful dharma-treasures of the world's Eastern
heritage, will at last be fully appreciated by, and benefit, its
Western readers.
This tremendous work of translating The Blue Cliff Record
has not previously been done by American scholars and is to be
highly appreciated and praised. Western Zen Buddhists have
waited a long time for a competent translation of this major
text; they need wait no longer.
Moreover, I appreciate the extra effort expended to translate
Master Tung Shan's Five Ranks and Master Fen Yang's Eight­

een Categories of Questions. While it is true that Hsueh Tou
was the first to append appreciatory verses to The Blue Cliff

Record, nonetheless it was Fen Yang who first began the prac­
tice of composing such verses for koans in general. So readers
may find these appended works of some special interest.
Regarding actual practice, I firmly believe that this transla­
tion is a milestone and will immensely benefit those who are
sincerely engaged in the practice and enlightenment of the
Buddha-way. Since Zen students must deal with these cases
meticulously and in great detail, it can be seen how indispens­
able is a translation such as this. These cases are, after all, more
than mere anecdotes of historical or philosophical interest.
They are the living record of generations of enlightened prac­
tice. It is my sincere hope that, in appreciating these cases
along with the verses, commentaries, and capping-phrases, the
reader will be enriched in his understanding of the practice and
accomplishment of Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, the Supreme
and Unexcelled Enlightenment.
A famous expression comes to mind:

"Before attaining enlightenment,
mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers.
At the moment of enlightenment,
mountains are no longer mountains, nor are rivers riv­
ers.
But after accomplishing enlightenment,
mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers."
This expression deals with three stages of practice. It is vital

xiv

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

that the reader understand that the "mountains are mountains,
rivers are rivers " experience after enlightenment is not at all
the same as before such a realization.We cannot dispense with
the "mountains are no longer mountains,nor are rivers rivers "
aspect, which requires that the individual clearly realize his
own true nature.
Although we know that all animate and inanimate beings
are intrinsically buddhas,mere know i n g is

not

enough.Dagen

Zenji says, "This dharma, (enlightened life) is abundantly in­
herent in each individual; nevertheless, without practice it
will not be revealed,and without enlightenment it will not be
realized."
The Blue Cliff Record reveals to us what enlightenment is,
what the enlightened life is,how the patriarchs and masters of
old struggled with it, attained it, actualized it, and accom­
plished it.
Penetrating the Blue Cliff,you will open "...the eye within
eyes," and realizing life through the Blue Cliff, you yourself
will become a torch, "...the light beyond light."
Being so, you will find no door at which to knock, nor any
door to be opened.

Preface

The introductory essay in this volume is intended to introduce
some aspects of the tradition behind the classic Ch'an Buddhist

kung an collection Pi Yen Lu which is presented here in En­
glish translation as The Blue Cliff Record.

The Chinese and Japanese pronunciations Ch'an and Zen

are used in this volume because they are most familiar to
Westerners, and it has been the Chinese and Japanese tradi­

tions of Ch'an which have thus far indirectly and directly most

affected the early growth of Zen in the West. Ch'an also existed
and exists in Korea and Vietnam, and contacts between these
traditions and Western students have begun; for all of these,

however, Chinese Ch'an is the ancestral tradition, and this will
be our focus in the introduction to this volume.

Our primary aim is not historical record or doctrine as they
are conventionally understood. Some books have touched on

the subject, but there is as yet hardly any information in West­
ern languages about Ch'an Buddhist teaching and history, and

there are not enough authentic Ch'an texts translated to make
a modern historiography practical or clearly show what Ch'an
may mean in the present day.

When Buddhism crossed civilization boundaries in the past,

translation, study, and practice were carried on for centuries

before native schools of Buddhism emerged to present the

teachings in new, currently useful forms. Western civilization

has pretensions to objective scholarship and knowledge, with

advanced techniques of information retrieval, but with all this

has been slow to find out anything much about the Buddhist
teachings, a part of the human heritage which cannot be

claimed or relegated to any particular culture or time. An old

description of five kinds of ch'an, or meditation, depicts the

lowest as that of those seeking heavenly states; the next is that
of the ordinary person who sees cause and effect and practices

for the betterment of mental and physical health. Without
going on to speak of the rest, it is obvious that these first two
are with us now, and we can no longer be content with crude
XV

XVi

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

generalities, sectarian claims, or impressionistic accounts of
the nature of Ch'an Buddhism. The aim of this volume is to
present an authentic Ch'an text unencumbered by attempted
explanations based on preconceptions regarding the text itself
or the mental state of the reader.
Though we have sketched an outline of early to medieval
Chinese Ch'an, since Ch'an is not a doctrinal school, general­
izations about its historical forms are of limited usefulnessi in
an attempt to amend the shortcomings of a general approach,
therefore, this volume includes excerpts from the lives and
sayings of the Ch'an masters appearing in the main cases of
volume one, based on materials from several collections of
sayings, biographies, and "transmission of the lamp" records.
Though the introduction is in the beginning, the reader may
find it as interesting or useful to begin anywhere in the book.
Ch'an expression is usually very concentrated, and most re­
corded sayings of Ch'an masters come from people in special
communities where the level of effort would be more intense
than that of much of ordinary life in society. The reader must
see through whatever cultural peculiarities are inevitable in an
eight hundred and fifty year old book from another civilizationi
in doing so the reader must also see through present cultural
peculiarities of thought and action, an effort which is itself a
task of meditation. This book is not presented as a fossil em­
bedded in the dust of a distant past, for the essence of Ch'an,
the essence of mind, is timeless and placeless.

Introduction

The Blue Cliff Record is a translation of the Chinese Ch'an
Buddhist classic Pi Yen Lu,

1

a collection of one hundred anec­

dotes of sayings and doings mainly from traditional accounts of
Ch'an teachers and disciples, illustrated in verse and prose by
outstanding Ch'an masters of later times. This set of one
hundred kung an, "public cases"2 of ancient events, was com­
piled by the eminent Sung dynasty Ch'an master Hsueh Tou
Ch'ung Hsien (980-1052); Hsueh Tou pointed out the import
of each story with verses and additional remarks of his own, as
aid and guidance for observation and contemplation. About
sixty years after Hsueh Tau's death, another excellent Ch'an
teacher, Yuan Wu K'e Ch'in (1063-1135), gave a series of talks
elucidating the original anecdotes and the verses of Hsueh
Tau's collection. The anecdotes, Hsueh Tau's verses, and Yuan
Wu's introductions, remarks, and commentaries all together
form The Blue Cliff Record, named after the abode on Mt. Chia
in Hunan where Yuan Wu once delivered his talks. This book
has long been considered as one of the finest works of Ch'an
literature, and defies adequate description short of its own
presentation.
The Buddha Gautama, Shakyamuni, whom all Buddhists re­
gard as their ancestor, invented and adapted various teachings
and techniques to liberate people; he was likened to a skilled
physician giving specific medicines to cure certain diseases. It
is said, therefore, that there is no fixed teaching. Yet in spite of
outward differences resulting from necessary adaptation to dif­
ferent situations, capacities of understanding and personality
configurations, the real Buddha Dharma, the teaching of the
enlightened ones, is of one uniform flavor, the flavor of libera­
tion. Just as many streams lead to the ocean, where they merge
into the uniform flavor of salt, goes the ancient metaphor, so
do the teachings of enlightenment lead to the ocean of en­
lightenment and merge into the uniform flavor of liberation.
When this essence is lost, and people enshrine relics of past
method for a sense of personal satisfaction, righteousness, or
xvii

xviii

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

comfort, then it is said that the medicine has become a disease.
It is the practice of Ch'an and all real Buddhism to cut through
all ploys of egoism in all its guises, "holy" or "profane," to
break up stultifying material and intellectual idolatry.
A Ch'an master once wrote that the wise enshrine the
miraculous bones of the ancients within themselves; that is,
they do not regard teachings of ways to enlightenment as an
external body of knowledge or information to be possessed as
an acquisition or believed or revered as inflexible dogma, but
rather apply it as far as possible to themselves and their situa­
tions, vivifying the way of enlightenment with their own
bodies and lives, not just in their thoughts. It is therefore a
matter of course that new Buddhist literature has been pro­
duced; for the Buddhist canon is not closed, as long as people
continue the search for enlightenment. This is where a con­
sideration of Buddhist history has some meaning: to help us
see what ages and what is ageless.
As many Buddhist texts and practitioners entered Chinese
civilization during the first millennium A.D., overtly represent­
ing different trends of thought and action, Chinese Buddhists
developed, through study and practical application and ex­
perimentation, systems of organization, analysis, interpreta­
tion, meditation, and ritual. Several Buddhist schools arose in
China between the fifth and seventh centuries, including the
four major schools known as T'ien T'ai, Hua Yen, Pure Land
(Ching T'u), and Ch'an. The schools based on specific scrip­
tures and treatises and commentaries by Indian and Chinese
masters were referred to in Ch'an jargon as "doctrinal schools"
or "teaching schools."
The principal scriptures of the T'ien T'ai school are the Sad­
dharmapundarika ("Lotus of Truth") and Mahaparinirvana

("Great Decease"); of the Hua Yen, the Avatamsaka ("Gar­
land"); of the Pure Land, the Sukhavativyuha ("Lay of the Land
of Bliss"). Ch'an students generally read these scriptures, as
well as others such as the Vajracchedika ("Diamond Cutter"),
Surangama ("Heroic Going"), Vimalakirtinirdesa ("Teaching
of Vimalakirti"), and Lankavatara ("Descent into Sri Lanka");
thus, the study of classical Buddhist scriptures and treatises
and the practice of various meditation methods were in the
background of Ch'an studies, directly or indirectly, whether or

not living masters of the other schools were in existence. Later

Introduction

followers of the teaching schools often concentrated on the
works of the Chinese founders, who analyzed, synthesized, and
organized the numerous and extensive Buddhist teachings,
presenting them in a crystallized form for current use. Ch'an
students did likewise, concentrating on the great Ch'an mas­
ters, but kept contact with other forms of Buddhist teaching,
ancient and contemporary.
Ch'an was referred to by its followers as the "school of the
patriarchs" because it was transmitted by a living succession of
human exemplarsi not a school of doctrine, or philosophical or
scholastic interpretation, it was not based on any particular
scripture, but on the direct experience of the enlightened mind,
by whatever means currently necessary. There were many pro­
fessional lecturing monks who specialized in certain texts or
groups of texts, but Ch'an teachers originally did not make
systematic explanations of Buddhist texts or traditional teach­
ingsi many students learned about Buddhism in the lecturing
halls before coming to Ch'an study. Ch'an teachers drew freely
on the ancient "Teachings," using quintessential passages
from the scriptures to illustrate points in the course of their
talks to students, much in the same way as they came to use
sayings and anecdotes of earlier Ch'an masters. One of the
attachments that Ch'an teachers had to deal with when doctri­
nal Buddhism became too institutionalized and formally
traditionalized was the attachment of externalists and intellec­
tuals to names and forms which had come to be hallowed.
During the fifth and sixth centuries meditation studies de­
veloped considerably in China, especially in the northern
kingdoms. Early meditation adepts were generally ascetics and
strict disciplinarians, often living in secluded mountain areas
or in monasteries surrounding distinguished teachers or prac­
ticing alone. Recitation of scriptures, spells, and devotional
formulas was carried to great lengths by some early meditators,
and has been used to a greater or lesser extent throughout
Ch'an history.
Ch'an tradition recognizes Bodhidharma (4-6 c. A.D.) as its
first patriarch in China. He came to China in the late fifth or
early sixth century3 and traveled around for over fifty years,
teaching when the occasion arose. Bodhidharma is said to have
used the Lanl<avatara scripture in his teachingi this scripture
represents teach ings of the Yogacara, or "yoga practice" school,

XX

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

which says that reality as we conceive it is only mental, and
uses meditational techniques of yoga to break mental attach­
ments to mental processes which cause our discomfort and
confusion. Shakyamuni Buddha used ancient techniques of
yoga, but only to break concrete and abstract attachments and
realize moksha, freedom, not to attain supposedly higher
states. We have several documents purported to record teach­
ings of Bodhidharma; the standard slogan of later times was
that he pointed directly to the human mind, and undoubtedly
used various methods to accomplish this. Bodhidharma is said
to have had four adept disciples in China, and by the seventh
century was recognized as one of the few meditation teachers
of early times who inspired a continuing living succession.
Bodhidharma's principal heir Hui K'e (486-593), the second
patriarch, and his successor Seng Ts'an (d. 606), the third pa­
triarch, still living in a time of disunity and strife in what had
been the Chinese empire, seem to have wandered around, en­
gaging in local activity but never establishing any fixed abode
as teaching centers. Hui K'e spent many years in Yeh, a me­
tropolis in the northeast quarter of China, and is said to have
met ten enlightened students over the years. After large num­
bers of monks and nuns were made to return to lay life, and
monastic properties were taken by the governments in north­
ern China around 577, Hui K'e spent the last sixteen years of
his life dressed as a layman, even though the bans were later
lifted, and the Buddhist communities resumed their growth
and prosperity. He was opposed by an established Buddhist
teacher, as Bodhidharma had been opposed by both Indian and
Chinese lecturers, for unorthodox teachings and methods, and
eventually killed. Seng Ts'an, of whom almost nothing is
known, was also a layman when he met Hui K'e, who was his
teacher for ten years in the mountains of Anwei, evidently near
the close of the sixth century. He is said to have written the
long poem Hsin Hsin Ming4 which has always been popular
and is considered the first classic of Chinese Ch'an.
The fourth patriarch of Ch'an, Tao Hsin (580-651), settled
down on a mountain in central China for over thirty years, and
a community of five hundred people eventually gathered
around him. This community maintained its own livelihood,
and Tao Hsin ignored the invitations of the T'ang imperial
court, which usually richly patronized Buddhists. Tao Hsin is

Introduction

said to have spent two years on a journey to south China in
later life. He wrote a book about standards of conduct for
bodhisattvas, those following the path of knowledge of reality;
he also wrote a book on meditation, outlining various methods
and their effects, referring to various scriptural sources.5 Ch'an
had not been widespread during the times of the earlier pa­
triarchs, but with Tao Hsin it came to be known all over
China.
Tao Hsin was a strict teacher and only approved of one suc­
cessor out of his many disciples; this was Hung Jen

(602-675),

the fifth patriarch. Hung Jen was with Tao Hsin from the age of
seven until his late thirties, working by day and meditating by
night. Among Hung Jen's eleven enlightened successors were
Shen Hsiu (602-706) and Hui Neng (638-713): Shen Hsiu, a
learned monk as well as a meditation master, was considered
the sixth patriarch in the tradition of the so-called northern
school of Ch'an; Hui Neng, an illiterate wood-cutter, was con­
sidered the sixth patriarch in the tradition of the so-called
southern school. Teachers of the northern school worked
mostly in or near urban areas of north China, especially the
western capital of T'ang, Ch'ang An. These lineages died out by
the end of the T'ang dynasty. There is a saying in Ch'an that
each generation must go beyond its predecessors for the trans­
mission to continue.
Some documents of the northern school were brought to
Japan by the pilgrim Saicho in the early ninth century; Saicho
had actually met Ch'an people of the so-called ox head (Niu
T'ou) and northern schools, and included several texts docu­
menting the inclusion of Ch'an as the Bodhidharma Sect in the
four transmissions or heritages claimed by Tendai Buddhism in
Japan, along with the philosophy and cessation of thought and
observation of reality practices of T'ien T'ai, esoteric ritual, art,
spells, and scriptures of tantric Buddhism, and precepts for
bodhisattvas. The Bodhidharma Sect was brought to life for a
time by Dainichi Nonin and some dedicated students and suc­
cessors. Nonin was a Tendai student who specialized in Ch'an
meditation and had such profound realization that he began to
teach with effect. Many of the students of his successors and
their successors eventually joined the Zen master Dogen
(1200-1253), who returned from China in 1227 and gradually
began to write and teach. Criticized for not having a teacher's

xxii

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

bequest, Nonin sent two disciples to China with a statement
of his realization, and was acknowledged by a Lin Chi master,
of the southern school; so the reality behind Ch'an is not
sectarian.
Hui Neng had become enlightened in his mid-twenties
while a poor woodcutter in the frontier lands of south China.
He later traveled north to see Hung Jen, and became a work­
man in Hung Jen's community at Huang Mei. Hung Jen recog­
nized Hui Neng's enlightenment and after a short time passed
on to him the robe and bowl of Bodhidharma as symbols of the
patriarchate; he did this in secret, it is said, and sent Hui Neng
away, fearing the jealous wrath of the monks because Hui
Neng was a peasant from the uncivilized far south with no
formal training in Buddhism. After fifteen years of wandering,
Hui Neng reappeared in south China, became ordained as a
Buddhist monk, and began to teach at Pao Lin monastery near
the source of Ts'ao Ch'i, the Ts'ao Valley River. He awakened
many people, and most of the teachers who appear in The Blue
Cliff Record were descended from Hui Neng.
Little is known of most of Hui Neng's immediate disciples,
but in the succeeding generation there appeared two great mas­
ters, Shih T'ou Hsi Ch'ien (700-790) and Ma Tsu Tao Yi
(709-788), under whom Ch'an began to flourish in China as
never before. From these two masters were descended the so­
called "Five Houses and Seven Sects" of Ch'an which arose
from the ninth to eleventh centuries. Descended from Ma Tsu
were the Kuei-Yang and Lin Chi houses, named after Kuei Shan
Ling Yu (771-854), Yang Shan Hui Chi (813-890), and Lin Chi
Yi Hsuan (d. 867); during the eleventh century two great mas­
ters of Ch'an in the Lin Chi house, Huang Lung Hui Nan

(1002-1069) and Yang Ch'i Fang Hui (d. 1049), were so influen­
tial and produced so many enlightened successors that their
lineages became known as the Huang Lung and Yang Ch'i
sects, or streams. From Shih T'ou were descended the Ts'ao­
Tung, Yun Men, and Fa Yen houses, named after Tung Shan
Liang Chieh (807-869), Ts a o Shan Pen Chi (840-901), Yun
'

-

Men Wen Yen (d. 949), and Fa Yen Wen Yi (885-958). Referred
to as schools, sects, houses, or clans of Ch'an, they were not
sects in the sense of membership, but were terms of respect
given later to successions of living masters, called after the
reference names of their distinguished ancestors.

Introduction

xxiii

The five houses era was the most original and creative
eriod
of Ch'an teaching, source of much illustrative material
p
and symbolic method used in later times. A considerable body
of sayings and writings of the patriarchs and eminent heirs of
the five houses and seven sects has been preserved. The living
succession of the Kuei-Yang, the earliest house, died out in the
tenth century, after five generations; Kuei Shan's Admoni­
tions, a short treatise for Ch'an students, was used in Ch'an

communities for over a thousand years. Te Kuang, a Lin Chi
master in the second generation after Yuan Wu, sent this book
over to Dainichi Nonin in Japan, and it was the first Ch'an
book to be printed in that country.
The Fa Yen house also lasted about a century, while the Yun
Men house, extremely effective for several generations after
Hsueh Tou, lasted for some three hundred years and preserved
and transmitted a great deal of Ch'an literature. The Lin Chi
house, especially the Yang Ch'i branch, eventually became the
most powerful and long lived Ch'an succession in China, while
the Ts'ao Tung, not as prominent, nevertheless continued to
exist and play a part in the Ch'an work for many centuries.
The Kuei-Yang and Lin Chi houses were both descended
from Ma Tsu's great heir Pai Chang Huai Hai (720-814), who
wrote the "Pure Rules for Ch'an Gardens" and uttered the
famous dictum "One day without working is a day without
eating." Pai Chang is known for having formally established a
unique Ch'an monastic system. By the time of Kuei Shan, the
monasteries were so wealthy and populous and so many
monks were lazy and decadent that Kuei Shan wrote his little
book warning about the deception of abundant offerings and
supplies, criticizing the "rice bags" and "clothes hangers" who
joined monastic life for food, clothing, and shelter without
seriously trying to awaken to reality.
The Yun Men and Fa Yen houses were descended from the
powerful master Te Shan Hsuan Chien (d. 867) and his succes­
sor .I-Isueh Feng Yi Ts'un, a great teacher of over sixty en­
lightened disciples. Te Shan was famous for his use of the staff
to strike students; Hsueh Feng once had a major insight when
struck by Te Shan. Te Shan's contemporary Lin Chi was
equally famous for his shouting, and the "staff of Te Shan and
the shout of Lin Chi" is a standard Ch'an expression to be met
frequently in The Blue Cliff Record.

Kuang Tso, the outstanding Yun Men master of the time, he
asked, "When one does not produce a single thought, how can
there be any fault?" Chih Men called him closer: as Hsueh Tou
approached, Chih Men hit him on the mouth with his whisk;
as Hsueh Tou was about to open his mouth, Chih Men hit him
again, whereupon Hsueh Tou awoke. Hsueh Tou became a
great teacher, and is said to have had eighty-four enlightened
successors; through his living heirs and his great literary abil­
ity his brilliance shone and reached many people.
Yuan Wu K'e Ch'in was a master in the tenth generation of
the Lin Chi succession, descendent of Fen Yang Shan Chao and
Yang Ch'i Fang Hui. He studied with teachers of the Yun Men
and Ts'ao-Tung as well as both branches of the Lin Chi school
before he finally succeeded to Wu Tsu Fa Yen (d.

1104). Yuan

Wu, "Perfect Enlightenment," was one of the titles bestowed
on him by the Sung emperor Hui Tsung; he served as abbot and
teaching master in several major temples by imperial request,
and is said to have had seventy-five enlightened disciples. Be­
sides

The Blue Cliff Record, there are extensive records of

Yuan Wu's sayings, as well as a large collection of letters, many
to his enlightened disciples. All of the Rinzai Zen schools in
modern Japan are descended from Yuan Wu.
Hsueh Tou and Yuan Wu were from the schools of Ch'an
which seem to have most emphasized work with kung an; as is
usual in the doings of Ch'an teachers, there were different ways
of using the stories and sayings of the ancients. In general it
may be said that contemplation and gradual application as well
as complete concentration without thought were used, and we
have both discursive and abrupt comments on the cases from
various masters. The method of concentration without think­
ing, used to stop mind wandering without letting it sink into
oblivion, generally focused on a word or phrase, called a hua
tou, and was used a lot by later Lin Chi masters. The Blue Cliff
Record gives excellent insight into what the stories point to,
and advice on how to apply them in life.

The Blue Cliff Record gained great popularity in a short
time, so much so that Ta Hui, an influential successor of Yuan
Wu sometimes called the second coming of Lin Chi, destroyed
the printing blocks because he observed that enthusiasm for
eloquence and beauty of expression was hindering people from
directly experiencing enlightenment on their own. In Ta Hui's

Introduction

xxv

Ch'an is based on the actual experience of enlightenment,
and though Ch'an students generally still studied major great
vehicle Buddhist scriptures, the sayings and doings of en­
lightened Ch'an masters came to supplant the Indian Buddhist
scriptures as guides, indications and inspiration for their con­
duct, meditation, and knowledge. The production of such
books as The Blue Cliff Record was an outgrowth of the "recol­
lections of the Buddhas" which was part of the practice of
Ch'an. Although it seems from the sayings of Yuan Wu that
many students wasted Ch'an literature by remaining in con­
ceptual or aesthetic views, it seems that the use of "public
cases" of the ancients was instrumental in revivifying the in­
spiration of Ch'an practice, especially as contact between
teacher and disciple became more ritualized. In later Ch'an
literature there are many stories of people awakening under the
impact of a phrase or event, a sight or a sound, after becoming
engrossed in a story or s�ying through contemplation and ob­
servation.
The practice of observation of sayings seems to have been
applied with great effect by some masters in Sung times, and
the literature which grew up around it concentrated the rich
legacy of the highly original T'ang and Five Dynasties (906960) masters and provided "grammars," as it were, of Ch'an
idiom, and methods of describing Ch'an history and medita­
tion states. Eventually traditional modes of expression and
transformation became widely used as a medium for question
and discussion of Ch'an, though there is a virtually endless
variety of detail. A good deal of Zen literature of medieval
Japan also consists of recorded sayings and poems in terse sym­
bolic style like the Sung masters who founded several streams
of Ch'an in Japan; part of the reason for this was the need to
communicate in writing between Chinese teachers and
Japanese students. Japanese masters inherited this style some­
what, and continued to write in Chinese for over five hundred
years, but also produced a parallel literature in Japanese which
came to be quite different in style from the Chinese.
Hsueh Tou Ch'ung Hsien, fourth patriarch and reviver of the
Yun Men school, visited the lecturing halls after his ordination
and was unmatched in the study of the Buddhist scriptures and
treatises; he was considered a "vessel of the Dharma" by his
teachers and urged to study Ch' an. When he met Chih Men

time there were still numerous enlightened teachers, and a
long tradition; Ta Hui wrote and spoke a great deal, especially
denouncing repetitious imitation Ch'an without enlighten­
ment. One of his techniques was to reject all answers to kung

an; his dynamic methods were very effective in his time, and
he produced over ninety enlightened disciples, but his lineage
died out after a few generations.
We in the West are lacking even in information about Ch'an,
and many of the accounts we have been given in the last fifty
years or so are quite confused and confusing, engendering mis­
conceptions about Ch'an, if not about reality. These The Blue

Cliff Record seriously challenges and can help us to see
through if we do not insist upon our customary habits of
thought. There are at least four books on the same model as

The Blue Cliff Record made by Ts'ao-Tung masters after Yuan
Wu's time, and innumerable other books related to Buddhism
from all ages: instructions on conduct and meditation, re­
corded sayings, collections of incidents, remarks, conversa­
tions, poetry, general and specific treatises in prose and poetry
on various aspects of Ch'an history, symbolism, contemporary
situations, psychology, practice and realization. Certain com­
munities in the present may find particular books useful and
ignore others, but for the common human heritage over a
longer period of time, individual communities or scholars can­
not canonize only certain aspects of Buddhism. The publica­
tion of The Blue Cliff Record in English will help to open new
vistas in the study of Buddhism in the West, but is only part of
a larger task. Though even one story in this volume can reveal
infinite implications to those of profound insight, for a larger
audience the dimensions of the impact of The Blue Cliff Rec­

ord will expand through long contemplation facilitated by the
mirrors of other Ch'an and Buddhist texts as they become
available.
Ultimately, the appreciation and usefulness of this book is
in the hands of the reader. Its literary expressiveness is so rich
that it can hardly fail to make an impression, even though the
book was not translated as a literary work. Even the manifest
content of this work provides a certain sustenance: the univer­
sality of the message beckons us on, and its immediate chal­
lenge can inspire us to profounder levels of insight. Even Ha­
kuin, considered the greatest Zen master in Japan in the last

five hundred years, said that he still had new insights on cer­
tain sayings after having lectured on The Blue Cliff Record for
thirty years. Ch'an masters tell us to look right where we stand
and step: they ask what is there, is there anything, who are you
and where do you come from, what did you see and hear when
you were there? -in a hundred ways they try to make us wake
up, clear our minds, and face reality directly. While people
pursue various paths, the inexorable laws of cause and effect
will be their inconceivable partner on every turn of every path,
regardless of the conceptions we may have about what is going
on. The effort of the student is an essential ingredient in Ch'an,
so explanation is minimal.
The format of this translation of The Blue Cliff Record is as

VERSE:

Fortunately, this is not a presentation of a system, and while
the happenings reflect on each other, they do so by their own
coherence; southern Ch'an was known as the "abrupt school,"
and its expression tends to be concise and quintessential. It is
said that if one thoroughly penetrates one phrase, one pene­
trates innumerable phrases at the same time.

Monks' names consist of two two-syllable names; a place
name, epithet, or title, and an individual initiatory name. Ex­
ceptions to this custom are self-evident and do not need special
treatment. Of famous monks, usually only the first name of
two syllables (generally the place name-of the mountain,
monastery, or city, etc., where the master lived and taught) is
used, or, when already mentioned in the context, the second
syllable of the first name. In the case of later monks teaching in
the same places as famous ancient masters, the whole first
name and the second name or second syllable of the second
name are used. We have generally followed this custom. Dia­
critical marks are omitted from Sanskrit names as well as from
Japanese names and terms. Translator's notes are marked by

Original Preface to The Blue
Cliff Record

The lifeline of the perfect sages, the great capacity of the suc­
cessive Patriarchs, the miraculous method of changing the
bones, the wondrous art of nourishing the spirit-the Ch'an
Master Hsueh Tau had the true eye which transcends any sect
and goes beyond patterns; he upheld the true imperative and
did not reveal a customary standard. He took up the hammer
and tongs to smelt and forge Buddhas and Patriarchs, and ver­
sified the transcendental noses of the patchrobed monks. A
silver mountain, an iron wall; who could dare try to bore in? A
mosquito trying to bite an iron ox cannot manage to penetrate.

If you do not meet a great Master, how can you thoroughly
comprehend the abstruse subtleties?
Here there is an old man, Yuan Wu; when he was dwelling
at the Blue Cliff, students were confused and asked him for
instruction. The old man pitied them and therefore extended
his compassion; he dug out the profound source and elucidated
the underlying principles. Directly pointing at the ultimate,
how could he have set up any opinionated understanding? The
hundred public cases are pierced through on one thread from
the beginning; the whole crowd of old fellows are all judged in
tum.
You should know that the jewel of Chao was flawless to
begin with; Hsiang Ju brazenly fooled the king of Ch'in. The
ultimate path is in reality wordless; masters of our school ex­
tend compassion to rescue the fallen. If you see it like this,
only then do you realize their thoroughgoing kindness. If, on
the other hand, you get stuck on the phrases and sunk in the
words, you won't avoid exterminating the Buddha's race.
P'u Chao was fortunate to be close to the Master's seat and
was able to hear what he had never heard before. Companions
in the Way compiled it into a volume, and this stupid oaf has
reported the root and branches of the matter.
At the time it is the last day of the month in late spring,

cessor to the Patriarchs, humbly writes this preface.

A long time ago a king offered to trade fifteen cities to an­

other king in exchange for a single jewel. When the emissary
came with the jewel and handed it over, he saw that the first
king was reluctant to part with his cities; he then recovered the
jewel by claiming it was flawed and threatened to smash it
unless the king honored his part of the bargain, whereat the
king relented. Unless we are willing to give up our attach­
ments, we cannot appreciate the priceless jewel of our true
nature. Each case of the Blue Cliff Record shows us not only
where to find the jewel, but also how to dig it out and cut and
polish it to bring out its inherent beauty and magnificence.

The Highest Meaning of the Holy
Truths

POINTER

When you see smoke on the other side of a mountain, you al­
ready know there's a fire; when you see horns on the other side
of a fence, right away you know there's an ox there. To under­
stand three when one is raised, to judge precisely at a glance­
this is the everyday food and drink of a patchrobed monk. Get­
ting to where he cuts off the myriad streams, he is free to arise
in the east and sink in the west, to go against or to go with, in
any and all directions, free to give or to take away. But say, at
just such a time, whose actions are these? Look into Hsueh
Tau's trailing vines.

CASE

Emperor Wu of Liang asked the great master Bodhidharma, 1
"What

is

the

highest

meaning

of

the

holy

truths?"2

Bodhidharma said, "Empty, without holiness."3 The Emperor
said, "Who is facing me?"4 Bodhidharma replied, "I don't
know."5

The

Emperor

did

not

understand.6

After

this

Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtse River and came to the king­
dom of Wei.7
Later the Emperor brought this up to Master Chih and asked
him about it. 8 Master Chih asked, "Does your majesty know
who this man is?"9 The Emperor said, "I don't know."10 Master
Chih said, "He is the Mahasattva Avalokitesvara, transmitting
the Buddha Mind Seal."11 The Emperor felt regretful, so he
wanted to send an emissary to go invite (Bodhidharma to re­
turn).12 Master Chih told him, "Your majesty, don't say that
you will send someone to fetch him back.13 Even if everyone in
the whole country were to go after him, he still wouldn't re­
turn."14

12. After all, Bodhidharma couldn't be held. As I said before, Wu is

dull.
13. When someone in the eastern house dies, someone of the western

house joins in the mourning. Better they should be all driven out
of the country at once.
14. Again Master Chih deserves thirty blows. He doesn't know that

the great illumination shines forth from under his own feet.

COMMENTARY

From afar Bodhidharma saw that this country (China) had
people capable of the Great Vehicle, so he came by sea, intent
on his mission, purely to transmit the Mind Seal, to arouse and
instruct those mired in delusion. Without establishing written
words, he pointed directly to the human mind (for them) to see
nature and fulfill Buddhahood. If you can see this way, then
you will have your share of freedom. Never again will you be
turned around pursuing words, and everything will be com­
pletely revealed. Thereafter you will be able to converse with
Emperor Wu and you will naturally be able to see how the
Second Patriarch's mind was pacified.a Without the mental
defilements of judgement and comparison, everything is cut

off, and you are free and at ease. What need is there to go on
distinguishing right and wrong, or discriminating gain and
loss? Even so, how many people are capable of this?
Emperor Wu had put on monk's robes and personally ex­
pounded the Light-Emitting Wisdom Scripture; he experienced
heavenly flowers falling in profusion and the earth turning to
gold. He studied the Path and humbly served the Buddha, issu­
ing orders through out his realm to build temples and ordain
monks, and practicing in accordance with the Teaching. People
called him the Buddha Heart Emperor.
When Bodhidharma first met Emperor Wu, the Emperor
asked, "I have built temples and ordained monks; what merit
is there in this?" Bodhidharma said, "There is no merit." He
immediately doused the Emperor with dirty water. If you can
penetrate this statement, "There is no merit," you can meet
Bodhidharma personally. Now tell me, why is there no merit at
all in building temples and ordaining monks? Where does the
meaning of this lie?
Emperor Wu held discussions with Dharma Master Lou
Yueh, with Mahasattva Fu, and with Prince Chao Ming about
the two truths, the real and the conventional. As it says in the
Teachings, by the real truth we understand that it is not exis­
tent; by the conventional truth we understand that it is not
nonexistent. That the real truth and the conventional truth are
not two is the highest meaning of the holy truths. This is the
most esoteric, most abstruse point of the doctrinal schools.
Hence the Emperor picked out this ultimate paradigm to ask
Bodhidharma, "What is the highest meaning of the holy
truths?" Bodhidharma answered, "Empty, without holiness."
No monk in the world can leap clear of this. Bodhidharma
gives them a single swordblow that cuts off everything. These
days how people misunderstand! They go on gi ving play to
their spirits, put a glare in their eyes and say, "Empty, without
holiness!" Fortunately, this has nothing to do with it.
My late Master Wu Tsu once said, "If only you can penetrate
'empty, without holiness,' then you can return home and sit in
peace." All this amounts to creating complications; still, it
does not stop Bodhidharma from smashing the lacquer bucketh
for others. Among all, Bodhidharma is most extraordinary. So
it is said, "If you can penetrate a single phrase, at the same
moment you will penetrate a thousand phrases, ten thousand

4

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

phrases." Then naturally you can cut off, you can hold still. An
Ancient said, "Crushing your bones and dismembering your
body would not be sufficient requital; when a single phrase is
clearly understood, you leap over hundreds of millions."
Bodhidharma confronted the Emperor directly; how he in­
dulged! The Emperor did not awaken; instead, because of his
notions of self and others, he asked another question, "Who is
facing me?" Bodhidharma's compassion was excessive; again
he addressed him, saying, "I don't know." At this, Emperor Wu
was taken aback; he did not know what Bodhidharma meant.
When you get to this point, as to whether there is something or
there isn't anything, pick and you fail.
Master Shou Tuan had a verse which said,
Ordinarily a single arrow fells a single eagle;
Another arrow is already too many.
Bodhidharma goes right back to sit before Few
Houses Peak;
0 Lord of Liang, speak no more of going to summon

him.

He also said, "Who wants to summon him back?"
Since Emperor Wu did not understand, Bodhidharma se­
cretly left the country; all this old fellow got was embarrass­
ment. He crossed the Yangtse River into Wei; at the time, the
Hsiao Ming Emperor of Wei was reigning there. This emperor
belonged to a northern tribe named Toba, who were later to
call themselves Chinese. When Bodhidharma arrived there, he
did not appear for any more audiences, but went directly to
Shao Lin Monastery, where he sat facing a wall for nine years,
and met the Second Patriarch. People thereabouts called him
"The Wall-Gazing Brahmin."
Emperor Wu of Liang later questioned Master Chih. Chih
said, "Does your majesty know who this man is?" The Em­
peror said, "I don't know." Tell me, is this ("I don't know") the
same as what Bodhidharma said, or is it different? In appear­
ance it indeed seems the same, but in reality isn't. People often
misunderstand and say, "Before, when Bodhidharma said 'I
don't know' he was replying about Ch'an; later, when Emperor
answered Master Chih, this referred to the 'knowledge' of
mutual acquaintance." This is irrelevant. Tell me, when Mas­
ter Chih questioned him, how could Wu have answered? Why

First Case

5

didn't he strike Chih dead with a single blow and avoid being
seen as a fool? Instead Emperor Wu answered Master Chih
sincerely and said, "I don't know." Master Chih saw his chance
and acted; he said, "This is the Mahasattva Avalokitesvara
transmitting the Buddha Mind Seal." The Emperor felt regret
and was going to send an emissary to bring Bodhidharma back.
How stupid! When Chih said, "This is Mahasattva Avalokites­
vara transmitting the Buddha Mind Seal," if Wu had driven
him out of the country, this would have amounted to some­
thing.
According to tradition, Master Chih died in the year 514,
while Bodhidharma came to Liang in 520; since there is a seven
year discrepancy, why is it said that the two met? This must be
a mistake in the tradition. As to what is recorded in tradition, I
will not discuss this matter now. All that's important is to
understand the gist of the matter. Tell me, Bodhidharma is
Avalokitesvara, Master Chih is Avalokitesvara, but which is
the true Avalokitesvara? Since it is Avalokitesvara, why are
there two? But why only two? They are legion.
Later in Wei, Bodhidharma debated with the Vinaya Master
Kuang T'ung and the canonical master Bodhiruci. The Master
Bodhidharma eliminated formalism and pointed to mind; be­
cause of their biased judgments, (the other two) would not put
up with this, and instead developed feelings of malevolence
and tried to poison Bodhidharma several times. On the sixth
attempt, since his mission was completed and he had found
someone to succeed to the Dharma, Bodhidharma made no
further attempt to save himself, but sat upright and passed on.
He was buried at Tinglin Temple on Bear Ear Mountain. Af­
terwards, while Sung Yun of Wei was on a mission, he met the
Master in the Ts'ung Ling Range (in Sinkiang), carrying one
shoe in his hand, returning (to India).
Emperor Wu mourned Bodhidharma's death and personally
wrote an inscription for his monument. It read, "Alas! I saw
him without seeing him, I met him without meeting him, I
encountered him without encountering him; now as before I
regret this deeply." He further eulogized him by saying, "If
your mind exists, you are stuck in the mundane for eternity; if
your mind does not exist, you experience wondrous en­
lightenment instantly."
Tell me, where is Bodhidharma right now? You've stumbled
past him without even realizing it.

COMMENTARY

Now as for Hsueh Tou's verse on this case, it is like skillfully
doing a sword dance; sure and relaxed in mid-air, he naturally
does not run afoul of the sharp point. If he lacked this kind of
ability, as soon as he picked it up we would see him run afoul
of the point and wound his hand. For those who have the eye to
see, Hsueh Tou offers, takes back, praises, and deprecates,
using only four lines to settle the entire public case.
Generally, eulogies of the Ancients express Ch'an in a
roundabout way, picking out the main principles of the old
story, settling the case on the basis of the facts, and that is all.
Hsueh Tou gives a thrust and says right off, "The holy truths
are empty-how can you discern the point?" Beneath that first
phrase, he adds this one, which is quite extraordinary. Tell me,
after all how will you discern the point? Even if you have an
iron eye or a copper eye, still you will search without finding.
When you get here, can you figure it out by means of emo­
tive consciousness? This is why Yun Men said, "It is like flint
struck sparks, like flashing lightening." This little bit does not
fall within the scope of mental activity, intellectual con­
sciousness, or emotional conceptions. If you wait till you open
your mouth, what good will it do? As soon as judgement and
comparison arise, the falcon has flown past Korea.
Hsueh Tou says, "How will all you monks distinguish the
real point? Who is facing the Emperor?" He adds the line,
"Again he said, 'I don't know.' " This is where Hsueh Tou is
excessively doting, redoubling his efforts to help people. Now
tell me, are "empty" and "I don't know" the same or different?
If you are someone who has personally understood completely,
you will understand without anything being said. Someone

8

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

who has not understood completely will undoubtedly separate
them into two. Everywhere everyone always says, "Hsueh Tou
(merely) brings up (the case) again." They are far from knowing
that (the first) four lines of the verse complete the case entirely.
For the sake of compassion, Hsueh Tou versifies what hap­
pened: "Henceforth (Bodhidharma) secretly crossed the river;
how could he avoid the growth of a thicket of brambles?"
Bodhidharma originally came to this country to melt the stick­
ing points, untie the bonds, pull out the nails and draw out the
pegs, to cut down brambles for people: why then say that he
gave rise to a thicket of brambles? This is not confined to those
times; today the brambles under everyone's feet are already
several yards deep. "Though everyone in the whole country
goes after him, he will not come back; (Wu) goes on and on
vainly reflecting back." Obviously Wu is not a powerful man.
Tell me, where is Bodhidharma? If you see Bodhidharma, then
you see where Hsueh Tou helps people in the end.
Hsueh Tou feared that people would pursue intellectual
views, so he swung open the gate and brought out his own
understanding, saying, "Give up recollecting; what limit is
there to the pure wind circling the earth?" Once you give up
recollection, what will become of the affairs you busy your­
selves with? Hsueh Tou says, here and now the pure wind is
circling the earth. Throughout heaven and earth, what is there
that is limited? Hsueh Tou picks up the numberless concerns
of all ages and throws them down before you. This is not con­
fined to Hsueh Tou's time. What limit is there? All of you
people-what limit is there on your part?
Again Hsueh Tou feared that people would grab ahold at this
point, so again he exposed his skill; in a loud voice he asked,
"Is there any patriarch here?" And he answered himself,
"There is." Hsueh Tou doesn't hesitate to bare his heart en­
tirely here for the sake of others. Again he spoke up himself:
"Call him here to wash this old monk's feet." He certainly
diminishes the man's dignity, but at the same time he properly
offers his own hands and feet as well. Tell me, where does
Hsueh Tou's meaning lie? When you get here, can you call it an
ass? Can you call it a horse? Can you call it a patriarch? How
can it be named or depicted? The frequently expressed opinion
that Hsueh Tou is employing the Patriarch fortunately has
nothing to do with it. But tell me, after all what's going on

First Case

here? "I only allow that the old barbarian knows; I don't allow
that the old barbarian understands."

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

a.

Bodhidharma, the first Patriarch of Ch'an in China, was asked by
Hui K'e (Shen Kuang), the future Second Patriarch, to pacify his
mind for him; Bodhidharma said, "Bring me your mind and I will
pacify it for you." Hui K'e said, "When I search for my mind, I
cannot find it." Bodhidharma said, "I have pacified your mind for
you." At this Hui K'e was enlightened.

b.

A lacquer bucket, pitch black, is a Ch'an metaphor for ignorance;
to have "the bottom fall out of the bucket" is to become suddenly
enlightened. To smash the bucket means to become enlightened
or to enlighten others.

c.

To pierce someone's nostrils, as in putting a ring through a bull's
nose, means to master, to take control, to seize the advantage and
have the upper hand. When one's nostrils are in another's hands,
it means that one has been "caught," even be it metaphysically,
so to speak.

SECOND CASE

The Ultimate Path is Without
Difficulty

POINTER

Heaven and earth are narrow; sun, moon, and stars all at once
go dark. Even if blows of the staff fall like rain and shouts roll
like thunder, you still haven't lived up to the task of the fun­
damental vehicle of transcendence. Even the Buddhas of the
three times can only know it for themselves; the successive
generations of patriarchs have not been able to bring it up in its
entirety. The treasury of teachings of the whole age cannot
explain it thoroughly; clear eyed patchrobed monks cannot
save themselves completely. When you get here, how will you
ask for more instruction? To say the word "Buddha" is trailing
mud and dripping water; to say the word "Ch'an" is a face full
of shame. Superior people who have studied for a long time do
not wait for it to be said; latecoming beginners simply must
investigate and apprehend it.

CASE

Chao Chou, teaching the assembly, said,1 "The Ultimate Path
is without difficulty;2 just avoid picking and choosing.3 As
soon as there are words spoken, ,this is picking and choosing,"
,this is clarity."4 This old monk does not abide within clarity;5
do you still preserve anything or not?"6
At that time a certain monk asked, ,Since you do not abide
within clarity, what do you preserve?117
Chao Chou replied,

11

1 don't know either."8

The monk said, "Since you don't know, Teacher, why do
you nevertheless say that you do not abide within clarity?"9
Chao Chou said, ,It is enough to ask about the matter; bow
and withdraw."10

NOTES
1. What's the old fellow doing? Don't create complications!
2. Not hard, not easy.
3. What's in front of your eyes? The Third Patriarch is still alive.
4. Two heads, three faces. A little boasting. When a fish swims

through, the water is muddied; when a bird flies by, feathers fall.
5. His thieving intent already shows; where is the old fellow going?
6. He's defeated. Still there's something, or a half.
7. The monk presses him well; his tongue is pressed against the roof

of his mouth.
8. (The monk) crushed this old fellow dead; he has to fall back three

thousand miles.
9. Look! Where is he going? He's chased him up a tree.
10. Lucky thing he has this move; the old thief!

COMMENTARY

Chao Chou always used to bring up this saying; that is, "Just
avoid picking and choosing." This is from the Third Patriarch's
Seal of Faith in the Heart, which says,
The Ultimate Path is without difficulty;
Just avoid picking and choosing.
Just don't love or hate,
And you'll be lucid and clear.
As soon as you have affirmation and negation, "this is picking
and choosing," "this is clarity." As soon as you understand this
way, you have already stumbled past. When you're riveted
down or stuck in glue, what can you do? Chao Chou said,
"This is picking and choosing, this is clarity." People these
days who practice meditation and ask about the Path, if they do
not remain within picking and choosing, then they settle down
within clarity. "This old monk does not abide within clarity;
do you still preserve anything or not?" All of you people tell
me, since he is not within clarity, where is Chao Chou? And
why does he still teach people to preserve?
My late master Wu Tsu often would say, "I reach my hand
down to show you, but how do you understand?" But tell me,

12

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

where does he reach down his hand? Perceive the meaning on
the hook; don't stick by the zero point of the scale.
This monk coming forth was undeniably extraordinary; he
got ahold of Chao Chou's gap and proceeded to press him:
"Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?"
Chao Chou never used the staff or the shout; he just said, "I
don't know either." When being pressed by that (monk), any­
one but this old fellow would time and again be at a loss.
Fortunately this old fellow Chao Chou had freedom to turn
himself around in, so he answered him like this. Many follow­
ers of Ch'an these days will also say when asked, "I don't know
either; I don't understand." Nevertheless, though they are on
the same road, they are not in the same groove.
There was something special about this monk; only thus
could he ask, "Since you don't know, Teacher, why do you
nevertheless say that you do not abide within clarity?" An­
other good rejoinder! If it had been someone other than Chao
Chou, he never would have been able to explain. But Chao
Chou is an adept; he just said to him, "It's enough to ask about
the matter; bow and withdraw." As before, the monk had no
way to cope with this old fellow; all he could do was suck in
his breath and swallow his voice.
This is a very capable teacher of our clan; he does not dis­
cuss the abstruse or the mysterious, he does not speak of men­
tality or perspectivesa with you-he always deals with people
in terms of the fundamental matter. Thus he would have said,
"When we're reviling each other, I let you clamp beaks with
me; when we're spitting at each other, I let you spew me with
slobber." It is hardly known that while Chao Chou ordinarily
never used beating or shouting to deal with people, and only
used ordinary speech, still no one in the world could handle
him. It was all because he never had so many calculating
judgements: he could pick up sideways and use upside-down,
go against or go with, having attained great freedom. People
today do not understand this, and just say that Chao Chou did
not answer the question or explain it to the man. How little
you realize that you've stumbled past it.

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou knows where Chao Chou comes down; therefore
he versifies like this: "The Ultimate Path has no difficulties."
Then immediately following this, he says, "The speech is to
the point, the words are to the point." He raises one corner, but

14

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

doesn't come back with the other three; when Hsueh Tau says,
"In one there are many kinds; in two there's no duality," this is
like three comers returning to one. But tell me, where is it that
words are to the point, and speech is to the point? In one, why
are nevertheless many kinds, yet in two there is no duality? If
you don't have eyes, where will you seek?
If you can penetrate these two lines, this is the basis of the
ancient saying, "Fused into one whole, as of old you see that
mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers, long is long, short
is short, sky is sky, and earth is earth." But sometimes we call
sky earth and earth sky, sometimes we say that mountains are
not mountains and rivers are not rivers. Ultimately, how to
attain imperturbable tranquility? When the wind comes, the
trees move; when the waves swell, the boats ride high. In
spring it sprouts, in summer it matures, in fall it is harvested,
in winter it is stored; with uniform equanimity, everything
disappears of itself.
Thus this four-line verse abruptly cuts off; but Hsueh Tau
has extra ability, so he opens up the closed bag and gives a
summary account. As he said at first,
The Ultimate Path is without difficulty;
Speech is to the point, words are to the point.
In one there are many kinds;
In two there is no duality.

Though there aren't so many things, when the sun rises over
the horizon the moon goes down, and when the mountains
beyond the balustrade deepen, the waters grow cold. When you
get here, speech is indeed to the point, words are indeed to the
point, everything is the Path and all things are completely real.
Isn't this where mind and objects are both forgotten, fused into
one whole? At the beginning of the verse Hsueh Tau was too
solitary and steep; at the end, though, he is quite indulgent. If
you can bore right through and see and penetrate, naturally it
will be like the excellent flavor of ghee. If you don't forget your
emotional interpretations, then you'll see a profusion of confu­
sion, and you definitely won't understand this kind of talk.
"When the skull's consciousness is exhausted, how can joy
remain? In the dead tree, dragon murmurs are not yet ended."
This is just a bit of combination. These are from public cases of
ancient questions about the Path, which Hsueh Tau has drawn

Second Case

15

out, pierced through and strung on the same thread to use in
versifying "The Ultimate Path is without difficulty; just avoid
picking and choosing." People these days don't understand the
Ancient's meaning, and only chew on the words and gnaw on
the phrases; when will they ever be done? If you are an adept
who is a master of technique, only then can you understand
this kind of talk.
Haven't you read how a monk asked Hsiang Yen, "What is
the Path?" Hsiang Yen said, "In a dead tree, dragon murmur­
ings." The monk asked, "What is a man of the Path?" Hsiang
Yen said, "Eyeballs in a skull." Later the monk asked Shih
Shuang, "What are 'dragon murmurings in a dead tree'?" Shih
Shuang said, "Still having joy." The monk asked, "What are
eyeballs in a skull?" Shih Shuang said, "Still having con­
sciousness." The monk also asked Ts'ao Shan, "What are
'dragon murmurings in a dead tree'?" Ts'ao Shan said, "The
blood line is not cut off." The monk asked, "What are 'eyeballs
in a skull'?" Ts'ao Shan said, "Not dried up." The monk asked,
"Who can hear this?" Ts'ao Shan said, "In the whole world,
there is no one who does not hear it." The monk asked, "What
book is 'dragon murmurings' taken from?" Ts'ao Shan said, "I
don't know what book it's from, but all who hear it die." He
also had a verse which said,
In a dead tree the dragon murmurs and truly sees
the Path;
When the skull has no consciousness, only then are
the eyes clear.
When joy and consciousness come to an end, all
happenings are ended;
How can such a one discriminate the pure in the

midst of impurity�
Hsueh Tau can be said to possess great skill in combining all
this at once in his verse. Though he has done this, there's been
no duality at all.
Hsueh Tau had help for people at the end of the verse when
he added "Difficult, difficult!" It's exactly this "difficult, dif­
ficult," that you must penetrate through in order to attain.
Why? Pai Chang said, "All words and speech, mountains, riv­
ers, and the great earth, each come back to oneself." Whatever
Hsueh Tau offers and takes back must ultimately be returned

16

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

to oneself. Tell me, how did Hsueh Tou help people when he
said, 11Picking and choosing? Clarity? See for yourself!"? He
had already created this complicated verse; why then did he
say 11See for yourself"? Tell me, what was his true meaning?
Don't say you can't understand. At this point, even I simply
cannot understand either.

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

Chi and ching, rendered in this instance as 'mentality and
perspective,' are very common technical terms, to be met with
many times in this book, used individually and as a pair. Both are
used in referring to both subjective and objective phenomena; in
Ch'an meditation they sometimes speak of 'forgetting' or 'merg­
ing' subject and object; likewise, as 'turning words' or 'pivotal
words,' these terms produce, individually and together, an effect
which cannot be rendered conveniently in a single English ex­
pression.

Chi is used for 'potential' (as of a student, or a situation),
'capability,' or a 'device' used to illustrate a point or state; it also
means mental activity or state in general. Sometimes the first, or
primary chi is contrasted to the secondary chi; this is like 'cogni­
tion' followed by 'recognition.'

Ching is a mental object, an object, a state, a realm or
sphere, a perspective (or perception). A common question is what
a master's ching is like (i.e. what does he 'see,' what is his sphere
or state of realization), and what the person in that 'realm' is like.
When Ch'an students experienced purity or bliss, or perceived
Buddhas and bodhisattvas in their meditations, they were told
these were merely ching, mental objects or 'states' which should
not be acknowledged as desirable or approved as real attainments,
lest one become intoxicated by one's state. Similarly, all kinds of
hallucinations were called

mo

ching or 'demon states,' illusory

objects or perceptions caused by 'demons' or 'devils' (whether
these are inside or outside the mind is a pointless question here),
obstructing the path of meditation.
As examples of chi-ching, Japanese commentaries conven­
tionally refer to such things as 'twinkling the eyes,' 'raising the
eyebrows,' 'raising the staff, the whisk, or the gavel,' gestures
frequently met with in Ch'an records as replies to questions, or

Second Case

17

teaching devices of the masters. Chi-ching thus means the men­
tality, or mental working, and the perspective, or object it em­
braces; an act and the state it manifests, a device and the ob­
ject(ive) it intends to convey. Ultimately, it seems that these
terms can refer to any action or speech and the implication or
impression it presents or represents, especially the intentional
gesture or remark of the teaching master.

sixteen-foot golden body (of Buddha); sometimes I take the

Originally Te Shan was a lecturing monk, expounding the
Diamond Cutter Scripture in western Shu (Szechuan). Accord­

ing to what it says in that teaching, in the process of the
knowledge attained after diamond-like concentration, one
studies the majestic conduct of Buddhas for a thousand aeons
and studies the refined practices of Buddhas for ten thousand
aeons before finally fulfilling Buddhahood. On the other hand,
the "southern devils" at this time were saying "Mind itself is
Buddha." Consequently Te Shan became very incensed and
went travelling on foot, carrying some commentaries; he went
straight to the South to destroy this crew of devils. You see
from how aroused he got what a fierce keen fellow he was.
When he first got to Li Chou (in Hunan), he met an old
woman selling fried cakes by the roadside; he put down his
commentaries to buy some refreshment to lighten his mind.
The old woman said, "What is that you're carrying?" Te Shan
said, "Commentaries on the Diamond Cutter Scripture." The
old woman said, "I have a question for you: if you can answer it
I'll give you some fried cakes to refresh your mind; if you can't
answer, you'll have to go somewhere else to buy." Te Shan
said, "Just ask." The old woman said, "The Diamond Cutter
Scripture says, 'Past mind can't be grasped, present mind can't

be grasped, future mind can't be grasped': which mind does the
learned monk desire to refresh?" Te Shan was speechless. The
old woman directed him to go call on Lung T'an.
As soon as Te Shan crossed the threshold he said, "Long
have I heard of Lung T'an ('Dragon Pond'), but now that I've
arrived here, there's no pond to see and no dragon appears."
Master Lung T'an came out from behind a screen and said,
"You have really arrived at Lung T'an." Te Shan bowed and
withdrew. During the night Te Shan entered Lung T'an's room
and stood in attendance till late at night. Lung T'an said, "Why
don't you go?" Te Shan bade farewell, lifted up the curtain, and
went out; he saw that it was dark outside, so he turned around
and said, "It's dark outside." Lung T'an lit a paper lantern and
handed it to Te Shan; as soon as Te Shan took it, Lung T'an
blew it out. Te Shan was vastly and greatly enlightened. Im­
mediately he bowed to Lung T'an, who said, "What have you
seen that you bow?" Te Shan answered, "From now on I will

teaching devices of the masters. Chi-ching thus means the men­
tality, or mental working, and the perspective, or object it em­
braces; an act and the state it manifests, a device and the ob­
ject(ive) it intends to convey. Ultimately, it seems that these
terms can refer to any action or speech and the implication or
impression it presents or represents, especially the intentional
gesture or remark of the teaching master.

THIRD CASE

Master Ma is Unwell

POINTER

One device, one object; one word, one phrase-the intent is
that you'll have a place to enter; still this is gouging a wound in
healthy flesh-it can become a nest or a den. The Great Func­
tion appears without abiding by fixed principles-the intent is
that you'll realize there is something transcendental; it covers
the sky and covers the earth, yet it cannot be grasped.
This way will do, not this way will do too-this is too dif­
fuse. This way won't do, not this way won't do either-this is
too cut off. Without treading these two paths, what would be
right? Please test; I cite this for you to see:

CASE

Great Master Ma was unwell.1 The temple superintendent
asked him, "Teacher, how has your venerable health been in
recent days?"2 The Great Master said, "Sun Face Buddha,
Moon Face Buddha."3.a

NOTES

1.

This fellow has broken down quite a bit. He's dragging in other
people.

Four hundred and four diseases break out all at once. They'll be
lucky if they're not seeing off a dead monk in three days. (This
question) is in the course of humanity and righteousness.

COMMENTARY

The Great Master Ma was unwell, so the temple superinten­
dent asked him, "Teacher, how has your venerable health been

in recent days?" The Great Master replied, "Sun Face Buddha,
Moon Face Buddha." If the patriarchal teachers had not dealt
with others on the basis of the fundamental matter, how could
we have the shining light of this Path? If you know what this
public case comes down to, then you walk alone through the
red skyi if you don't know where it comes down, time and
again you'll lose the way before the withered tree cliff. If you
are somebody in your own right, when you get here you must
have the ability to drive off the plowman's ox and to snatch
away the hungry man's food before you will see how Great
Master Ma helps people.
These days many people say that Master Ma was teaching
the superintendenti fortunately, this has no connection. Right
now in this assembly there are many who misunderstandi they
put a glare in their eyes and say, "It's herei the left eye is the
Sun Face, and the right eye is the Moon Face." What relevance
does this have? Even by the (non-existent) Year of the Ass, you
won't have seen it even in a dream. You just stumble past,
missing what the Ancient was about.
So when Master Ma spoke like this, where was his meaning?
Some say (he meant) "Fix some stomach medicine and bring
me a bowl of it." What grasp has this got on it? Having gotten
to this point, how would you attain tranquility? This is why it
is said, "The single road of transcendence has not been trans­
mitted by a thousand sagesi students trouble themselves with
forms like monkeys grasping at reflections."
This "Sun Face Buddha, Moon Face Buddha" is extremely
difficult to seei even Hsueh Tou finds it difficult to versify this.
But since he has seen all the way through, he uses his life's
work to the full to make his comment. Do you people want to
see Hsueh Tou? Look at the text below.

VERSE

Sun Face Buddha, Moon Face Buddha;
**When he opens his mouth you see his guts.
(Ma and Hsueh Tou) are like two facing mirrors;
in between there's no image or reflection.*
What kind of people were the Ancient Emperors?
**Too lofty. Don't belittle them. They
can be valued high or low.*

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

For twenty years I have suffered bitterly;
**This is your own fall into the weeds­

How many times I have gone down into the Blue Dragon's
cave for you!
**How was it worth this� Don't misuse your mind.
Don't say there isn't anything extraordinary here.*
This distress
**He saddens people to death.
Sad man, don't speak to sad people.*
Is worth recounting;
**To whom would you speak of it?
If you speak of it to sad people,
you will sadden them to death.*
Clear-eyed patchrobed monks should not take it lightly.
**You must be even more thoroughgoing. Bah! Fall
back three thousand miles.*

COMMENTARY

When (the Sung Emperor) Shen Tsung was on the throne
(1068-1085) he thought that this verse ridiculed the state, so
he wouldn't let it be included in the (Buddhist) canon.
First Hsueh Tou quotes: "Sun Face Buddha, Moon Face
Buddha." Having brought this up, then he says, "What kind of
people were the Ancient Emperors?" Tell me, what is his
meaning? I just finished telling you a minute ago; Hsueh Tou is
commenting directly (on Master Ma). So it is said, "Letting
down his hook in the four seas, he only fishes for terrible drag­
ons." This one line has already been completed (the verse);
afterwards, Hsueh Tou versifies how he concentrated on study
and search all his life.
"For twenty years I have suffered bitterly; how many times
I've gone down into the Blue Dragon's cave for you!" What is
he like? He's like a man going into the Blue Dragon's cave to
seize the pearl. Afterwards he broke apart the lacquer bucket.
Though this might be considered quite extraordinary, basically

Third Case

21

it just amounts to "What kind of people were the Ancient
Emperors?" Tell me, what are Hsueh Tau's words getting at?
You have to take a step back on your own and look before you
will see where he's at.
So what kind of people were the Ancient Emperors anyway?
People mostly do not see Hsueh Tau's meaning, but only say
that he is ridiculing the state. To understand in this way is
merely an emotional view. This (line) comes from Ch'an
Yueh's poem on "The behavior of barons," which says,
Clothes in brocades and fine embroidery, with fal­
cons on their wrists,
They go about at leisure, their manner scornful.
They know nothing of the difficulties of sowing and
harvesting;
What kind of people were the Ancient Emperors�
Hsueh Tau says, "This distress is worth recounting; clear eyed
patchrobed monks must not take it lightly." How many people
make their livelihood within the Blue Dragon's cave? Even if
you're a clear eyed patchrobed monk with an eye on your
forehead and a talisman under your arm, shining through the
four continents, when you get here you still must not take it
lightly; you must be thoroughgoing.

Te Shan Carrying His Bundle

POINTER

Under the blue sky, in the bright sunlight, you don't have to
point out this and that anymore; but the causal conditions of
time and season still require you to give the medicine in
accordance with the disease. But tell me, is it better to let go, or
is it better to hold still? To test, I cite this: look!

CASE

When Te Shan arrived at Kuei Shan,1 he carried his bundle
with him into the teaching hall,2 where he crossed from east to
west and from west to east.3 He looked around and said,
"There's nothing, no one." Then he went out.4
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "Completely exposed."5
But when Te Shan got to the monastery gate, he said, "Still, I
shouldn't be so coarse."6 So he reentered (the hall) with full
ceremony to meet (Kuei Shan).7 As Kuei Shan sat there,8 Te
Shan held up his sitting mat and said, "Teacher!"9 Kuei Shan
reached for his whisk,10 whereupon Te Shan shouted, shook
out his sleeves, and left.11
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "Completely exposed."12
Te Shan turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his
straw sandals, and departed.13 That evening Kuei Shan asked
the head monk, "Where is that newcomer who just came?"14
The head monk answered, "At that time he turned his back on
the teaching hall, put on his straw sandals, and departed."15
Kuei Shan said, "Hereafter that lad will go to the summit of
a solitary peak, build himself a grass hut, and go on scolding
the Buddhas and reviling the Patriarchs."16
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "He adds frost to snow."17

NOTES

1. The board-carrying fellow, a the wild fox spirit! h
2. Unavoidably he causes people to doubt. He has suffered defeat.
3. He has a lot of Ch'an, but what for?
4. He deserves thirty blows of the staff. Indeed his spirit reaches the

heavens. A real lion cub can roar the lion's roar.
5. Wrong. After all. Check!
6. Letting go, gathering in. At first too high, in the end too low.

When one realizes one's fault one should reform, but how many
people can?
7. As before, he acts like this. It's already his second defeat. Danger!
8. (Kuei Shan) watches this fellow with cold eyes. It takes this kind

of man to grab a tiger's whiskers.
9. He changes heads, switches faces; he stirs up waves where there's

no wind.
10. Only that fellow could do this; he sets his strategy in motion from
within his tent. Nothing can stop him from cutting off the
tongues of everyone in the world.
11. This is the understanding of a wild fox spirit. This one shout
contains both the provisional and the real, both the illumination
and the function. They're all people who can grab the clouds and
grasp the fog, but he is outstanding among them.
12. Wrong. After all. Check!
13. The scenery is lovely, but the case is not yet completed. (Te Shan)
won the hat on his head but lost the shoes on his feet. He's
already lost his body and his life.
14. He lost his interest in the east, and loses his principal in the west.

His eyes look southeast, but his mind is in the northwest.
15. The sacred tortoise is dragging his tail;" he deserves thirty blows.
How many blows to the back of the head would it take for this
kind of fellow?
16. He draws his bow after the thief is gone. No patchrobed monk in

the world can leap out of this.
17. Wrong. After all. Check!

COMMENTARY

Three times I added the word "check." Do all of you under­
stand? Sometimes I take a blade of grass and use it as the

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

sixteen-foot golden body (of Buddha); sometimes I take the
sixteen-foot golden body and use it as a blade of grass.
Originally Te Shan was a lecturing monk, expounding the
Diamond Cutter Scripture in western Shu (Szechuan). Accord­

ing to what it says in that teaching, in the process of the
knowledge attained after diamond-like concentration, one
studies the majestic conduct of Buddhas for a thousand aeons
and studies the refined practices of Buddhas for ten thousand
aeons before finally fulfilling Buddhahood. On the other hand,
the "southern devils" at this time were saying "Mind itself is
Buddha." Consequently Te Shan became very incensed and
went travelling on foot, carrying some commentaries; he went
straight to the South to destroy this crew of devils. You see
from how aroused he got what a fierce keen fellow he was.
When he first got to Li Chou (in Hunan), he met an old
woman selling fried cakes by the roadside; he put down his
commentaries to buy some refreshment to lighten his mind.
The old woman said, "What is that you're carrying?" Te Shan
said, "Commentaries on the Diamond Cutter Scripture." The
old woman said, "I have a question for you: if you can answer it
I'll give you some fried cakes to refresh your mind; if you can't
answer, you'll have to go somewhere else to buy." Te Shan
said, "Just ask." The old woman said, "The Diamond Cutter
Scripture says, 'Past mind can't be grasped, present mind can't
be grasped, future mind can't be grasped': which mind does the
learned monk desire to refresh?" Te Shan was speechless. The
old woman directed him to go call on Lung T'an.
As soon as Te Shan crossed the threshold he said, "Long
have I heard of Lung T'an ('Dragon Pond'), but now that I've
arrived here, there's no pond to see and no dragon appears."
Master Lung T'an came out from behind a screen and said,
"You have really arrived at Lung T'an." Te Shan bowed and
withdrew. During the night Te Shan entered Lung T'an's room
and stood in attendance till late at night. Lung T'an said, "Why
don't you go?" Te Shan bade farewell, lifted up the curtain, and
went out; he saw that it was dark outside, so he turned around
and said, "It's dark outside." Lung T'an lit a paper lantern and
handed it to Te Shan; as soon as Te Shan took it, Lung T'an
blew it out. Te Shan was vastly and greatly enlightened. Im­
mediately he bowed to Lung T'an, who said, "What have you
seen that you bow?" Te Shan answered, "From now on I will

Fourth Case

25

never again doubt what's on the tongues of the venerable
teaching masters of the world."
The next day Lung T'an went up into the teaching hall and
said, "There is one among you with teeth like a forest of
swords and a mouth like a bowl of bloodi even if you hit him
with a staff, he wouldn't turn back. Another day he will ascend
to the summit of a solitary peak and establish my path there."
Then Te Shan took all his commentaries in front of the teach­
ing hall and raised a torch over them, declaring, "Even to
plumb all abstruse locutions is like a single hair in the great
voidi to exhaust the essential workings of the world is like a
single drop of water cast into a vast valley." Then he burned
the commentaries.
Later he heard that Kuei Shan's teaching was flourishing, so
he traveled to Kuei Shan to meet him as an adept. Without
even untying his bundle, he went straight to the teaching hall,
where he walked back and forth from east to west and west to
east, looked around, and said, "Nothing, no one." Then he
went out. Tell me, what was his meaning? Wasn't he crazy?
People misinterpret this as 'establishment,' but that is simply
irrelevant. See how extraordinary that Te Shan wasi this is why
it is said, "To stand out from the crowd, you must be a brave
spirited fellowi to defeat enemies is a matter for a lion's son. If
you try to become Buddha without an eye like this, how will
you ever do it, even in a thousand years?"
When you get here, you must be a thoroughly competent
adept before you will be able to see. Why? In the Buddha
Dharma there are not so many complicationsi where can you
bring intellectual views to bear? This is the action of (Te
Shan's) mindi where is there so much toil? This is why Hsuan
Sha said, "Even if you're like the moon reflected in an autumn
pond, which when striking the waves is not scattered, or like
the sound of a bell on a quiet night, which when hit never fails
to resound, this is still an affair on this shore of birth and
death." When you arrive here there is no gain or loss, no affir­
mation or negation, nor is there anything extraordinary or
mysterious. Since there is nothing extraordinary or mysteri­
ous, how will you understand (Te Shan's) going back and forth
from east to west and west to east? Tell me, what was his
meaning?
This old fellow Kuei Shan still was not taken in by that (Te

26

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Shan); anyone but Kuei Shan would have been crushed by him.
Look at how the old adept Kuei Shan meets him; he just sits
there and observes the outcome. If he did not profoundly dis­
cern the 'oncoming wind,' how could he have been like this?
Hsueh Tou adds the comment "Completely exposed." This is
like an iron spike. In the assembly this is called an added
comment: although it goes for both sides, it does not remain on
either side. How will you understand his statement, "Com­
pletely exposed"? Where does the complete exposure take
place? Tell me, is Te Shan completely exposed, or is it Kuei
Shan who is completely exposed?
On his way out Te Shan got as far as the monastery gate, but
then he said to himself, "Still, I shouldn't be so coarse." He
wanted to bring out his guts, his innermost heart, in a Dharma
battle with Kuei Shan; so he went back in with full ceremony
to meet him. As Kuei Shan sat there, Te Shan lifted up his
sitting mat and said, "Teacher!" Kuei Shan reached for his
whisk; Te Shan then shouted, shook his sleeves, and left. How
extraordinary!
Many in the assembly say that Kuei Shan was afraid of him.
What has this got to do with it? Kuei Shan was not flustered at
all. This is why it is said, "One whose wisdom surpasses a
bird's can catch a bird, one whose wisdom surpasses an ani­
mal's can catch an animal, and one whose wisdom surpasses a
man's can catch a man." When one is immersed in this kind of
Ch'an, even if the multitude of appearances and myriad forms,
heavens and hells, and all the plants, animals, and people, all
were to shout at once, he still wouldn't be bothered; even if
someone overthrew his meditation seat and scattered his con­
gregation with shouts, he wouldn't give it any notice. It is as
high as heaven, broad as earth. If Kuei Shan did not have the
ability to cut off the tongues of everyone on earth, at that time
it would have been very difficult for him to test Te Shan. If he
weren't the enlightened teacher of fifteen hundred people, at
this point he wouldn't have been able to explain anything. But
Kuei Shan was setting strategy in motion from within his tent
that would settle victory over a thousand miles.
Te Shan turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his
straw sandals, and departed. Tell me, what was his meaning?
You tell me, did Te Shan win or lose? Acting as he did, did Kuei

Fourth Case

27

Shan win or lose? Hsueh Tou commented, "Completely ex­
posed." Here he makes an effort and sees through the Ancients'
ultimate riddle; only thus could he be so extraordinary. Hsueh
Tou added "Completely exposed" twice, making a three part
judgement; only then had he revealed this public case. He was
like a bystander judging those two men.
Afterwards, this old fellow (Kuei Shan) was unhurried; when
evening came he finally asked the head monk, "Where is that
newcomer who just came?" The head monk replied, "At that
time, he turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his straw
sandals, and left." Kuei Shan said, "Hereafter that lad will go
up to the summit of a solitary peak, build himself a grass hut,
and go on scolding the Buddhas and reviling the Patriarchs."
But say, what was his meaning? Old man Kuei Shan was not
being good hearted; in the future Te Shan could scold the Bud­
dhas and revile the Patriarchs, pummel the wind and beat the
rain, yet he would still never get out of that cave. Te Shan's
whole lifetime's methods have been seen through by this old
fellow. Should we say that Kuei Shan has given him a prophecy
here? Or should we say that when the marsh is wide it can hide
a mountain, that reason<� can subdue a leopard? Fortunately
this has nothing to do with it.
Hsueh Tou knows what this public case comes down to, so
he can dare to settle it for them by further saying, "He adds
frost to snow." Once again he offers it up for people to see. If
you do see, I'll allow that you're a fellow student of Kuei Shan,
Te Shan, and Hsueh Tou. If you don't see, beware of vainly
producing intellectual interpretations.

COMMENTARY

When Hsueh Tau composed verses on one hundred public
cases, with each case he burned incense and offered it up;
therefore (his verses) have circulated widely throughout the
land. In addition he mastered literary composition. When he
had penetrated the public cases and become easily conversant
with them, only then could he set his brush to paper. Why so?
It is easy to distinguish dragons from snakes; it is hard to fool a
patchrobed monk. Since Hsueh Tau immersed himself in this
case and penetrated through it, he puts down three comments
at those impenetrable, misleading places, then picks them up
to make his verse.
"Adding frost to snow" -almost a dangerous fall. What is
Te Shan like? He is just like Li Kuang, by innate talent a skilled

Fourth Case

29

archer, whom the Emperor (Wu of Han) commissioned as the
General of the Flying Cavalry (Imperial elite corps). Li Kuang
penetrated deep into enemy territory, where he was captured
alive by the King of the Huns. Kuang was weak from wounds;
they tied him prone between two horses. Kuang played dead,
but stealthily observed that there was a Hun near him riding a
good mount. Kuang suddenly sprang up and leaped on the
horse, throwing down the Hun rider and seizing his bow and
arrows. Whipping the horse, he galloped off towards the South;
drawing the bow and shooting back at the riders pursuing him,
he thus made good his escape. This fellow had the ability to
wrest life from the midst of death; Hsueh Tou alludes to this in
the verse to make a comparison with Te Shan, who re-entered
(the teaching hall) to meet (Kuei Shan), and was able to leap out
again, as before.
Look at how that Ancient (Te Shan) sees all the way, speaks
all the way, acts all the way, and functions all the way; he's
undeniably a brave spirit. Only if you possess the ability to kill
a man without blinking an eye can you then become Buddha
right where you stand. Someone who can fulfill Buddhahood
right where he stands naturally kills people without blinking
an eye; thus he has his share of freedom and independence.
When some people these days are questioned, at first they
seem to have the qualities of a patchrobed monk, but when
they're pressed even slightly, their waists snap and their legs
break; they come all to pieces. They totally lack the slightest
continuity. That is why an Ancient said, "Continuity is indeed
very difficult." Look at how Te Shan and Kuei Shan acted; were
theirs stammering, halting views?
"How many could regain their safety? (Te Shan) hurriedly
runs past." Te Shan shouted and left; this is just like Li Kuang's
strategy after he was captured, seizing a bow to shoot and kill
his guard, and making good his escape from enemy territory.
Hsueh Tau's verse at this point has great effect.
Te Shan turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his
straw sandals and left. Some say he gained the advantage; how
far they are from realizing that this old fellow (Kuei Shan), as
before, still doesn't allow (Te Shan) to appear. Hsueh Tou says,
"He doesn't let him go." The same evening Kuei Shan asked
the head monk, "Where is that newcomer who just came?"
The head monk said, "Back then, he turned his back on the

30

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

teaching hall, put on his straw sandals and left." Kuei Shan
said, "Hereafter that lad will go up to the summit of a solitary
peak, build himself a grass hut, and go on scolding the Buddhas
and reviling the Patriarchs." When did he ever let him go?
Nevertheless, he's outstanding.
At this point, why does Hsueh Tau say, "On the summit of
the solitary peak, he sits among the weeds," and then add an
exclamation? Tell me, what does this come down to? Study for
thirty more years!

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

Someone carrying a board can only see one side, vision being
obstructed by the burden.

b.

A wild fox spirit is usually an expression of blame, referring to
someone who indulges in cleverness. According to an old story,
someone once became a wild fox because he said that an ac­
complished yogi is not subject to cause and effect. However, like
all'turning words,' this expression also has a positive side, mean­
ing one who has complete freedom of action.

c.

That is, he is leaving a trail. Some commentators explain the
general metaphor by saying that when a tortoise lays eggs in the
sand it covers them to hide them, but as it leaves its tail makes a
track, after all revealing the whereabouts of the eggs. This expres­
sion is thus similar to the Ch'an saying about hiding the body but
revealing the shadow.

d.

The alternate version of this saying is that "a cat can subdue a
leopard," meaning that the weaker can subdue the stronger. Con­
fusion arose from the similarity between the Chinese characters
used for "cat" and for "reason."

FIFTH CASE

Hsueh Feng's Grain of Rice

POINTER

Whoever would uphold the teaching of our school must be a
brave spirited fellow; only with the ability to kill a man with­
out blinking an eye can one become Buddha right where he
stands. Therefore his illumination and function are simultane­
ous; wrapping up and opening out are equal in his preaching.
Principle and phenomena are not two, and he practices both
the provisional and the real. Letting go of the primary, he sets
up the gate of the secondary meaning; if he were to cut off all
complications straightaway, it would be impossible for late­
coming students of elementary capabilities to find a resting
place. It was this way yesterday; the matter couldn't be
avoided. It is this way today too; faults and errors fill the skies.
Still, if one is a clear eyed person, he can't be fooled one bit.
Without clear eyes, lying in the mouth of a tiger, one cannot
avoid losing one's body and life. As a test, I cite this; look!

Yun Feng said, "Compared to above, not enough; compared
to below, too much. I am making up more complications for
you." He raised his staff and said, "Do you see Hsueh Feng?
Where the King's rule is a little more strict, it's not permitted
to plunder the open markets."
Che of Ta Kuei said, "I'll add more mud to dirt for you." He
raised his staff and said, "Look! Look! Hsueh Feng has defe­
cated right in front of you all. Come now, why don't you even
recognize the smell of shit?"
Hsueh Feng, teaching his assembly, said, "Pick up the whole
great earth in your fingers, and it's as big as a grain of rice."
There was something extraordinary in the way this Ancient
guided people and benefited beings. He was indefatigably rigor­
ous; three times he climbed (Mount) T'ou Tzu, nine times he
went to Tung Shan. Wherever he went, he would set up his
lacquer tub and wooden spoon and serve as the rice steward,
just for the sake of penetrating this matter.
When he arrived at Tung Shan, he served as the rice steward;
one day Tung Shan asked Hsueh Feng, "What are you doing?"
Hsueh Feng said, "Cleaning rice." Shan asked, "Are you wash­
ing the grit to get rid of the rice, or are you washing the rice to
get rid of the grit?" Feng said, "Grit and rice are both removed
at once." Shan said, "What will everybody eat?" Feng then
overturned the basin. Shan said, "Your affinity lies with Te
Shan," and he directed Feng to go see him.
As soon as he got there, Hsueh Feng asked, "Does this stu­
dent have any share in this matter handed down from antiquity
as the fundamental vehicle?" Te Shan struck him a blow and
said, "What are you saying?" Because of this, Hsueh Feng had
an insight.
Later Hsueh Feng was snowed in on Tortoise Mountain (in
Hunan). He told Yen T'ou, "When Te Shan hit me, it was like
the bottom falling out of a bucket." Yen T'ou shouted and said,
"Haven't you heard it said that what comes in through the gate
isn't the family treasure? You must let it flow out from your

Fifth

33

own breast to cover heaven and earth; then you'll have some
small portion of realization." Suddenly Hsueh Feng was greatly
enlightened; he bowed and said to Yen T'ou, "Elder brother,
today on Tortoise Mountain I have finally attained the Path."
People these days only say that the Ancient (Hsueh Feng)
made something up specially to teach people of the future fixed
precepts that they can rely on. To say this is just slandering
that ancient master; this is called "spilling Buddha's blood."
The Ancients weren't like people today with their spurious
shallow talk; otherwise, how could they have used a single
word or half a phrase for a whole lifetime? Therefore, when it
came to supporting the teaching of the school and continuing
the life of the Buddhas, they would spit out a word or half a
phrase which would spontaneously cut off the tongues of
everyone on earth. There's no place for you to produce a train
of thought, to make intellectual interpretations, or to grapple
with principles. See how Hsueh Feng taught his community;
since he had seen adepts, he had the hammer and tongs of an
adept. Whenever he utters a word or half a phrase, he's not
making his livelihood within the ghost caves of mental activ­
ity, ideational consciousness and calculating thought. He just
surpasses the multitudes and stands out from the crowd; he
settles past and present and leaves no room for uncertainty. His
actions were all like this.
One day Hsueh Feng said to his community, "On South
Mountain there's a turtle-nosed snake; all of you should take a
good look at it." Thereupon Wayfarer Leng (Ch'ang Ch'ing)
came forward from the assembly and said, "If so, then there are
a lot of people in this hall today who lose their bodies and
lives."
On another occasion Hsueh Feng said, "The whole great
earth is the single eye of a monk; where will you people go to
defecate?" Another time he said, "I have met with you at Wang
Chou Pavilion; I have also met with you in the Black Rock
Range, and I have also met with you in front of the monks'
hall." At the time Pao Fu asked E Hu, "Leaving aside 'in front
of the monks' hall,' what about the meetings at Wang Chou
Pavilion and Black Rock Range?" E Hu hurried back to his
room. Hsueh Feng was always bringing up this kind of talk to
instruct his community.
As for "Pick up the whole great earth in your fingers, and it's

34

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

as big as a grain of rice"-tell me, at this juncture, can you
figure it out by means of intellectual discrimination? Here you
must smash through the net, at once abandon gain and loss,
affirmation and negation, to be completely free and at ease; you
naturally pass through his snare, and then you will see what
he's doing. Tell me, where is Hsueh Feng's meaning?
People often make up intellectual interpretations and say,
"Mind is the master of myriad things; the whole great earth is
all at once in my hand." Fortunately, this has no connection.
Here you must be a true and genuine fellow, who penetrates
the bone through to the marrow, and sees all the way through
as soon as he hears it brought up, yet without falling into
emotional considerations or conceptual thinking. If you are a
genuine foot-traveling patchrobed monk, you will see that in
acting this way, Hsueh Feng was already indulging to help
others.
Look at Hsueh Tau's verse, which says,

VERSE

An ox head disappears,
**Like a flash of lightening.
You've already stumbled past it.*
A horse head emerges.
**Like sparks struck from flint. *
In the mirror of Ts'ao Ch'i, a absolutely no dust.
**Come smash the mirror and I will meet with
you; you must first smash it.*
He beats the drum for you to come look, but you don't see:
**He pierces your eyes. Don't take it lightly. In the
lacquer bucket, where is it hard to see?*
When spring arrives, for whom do the hundred flowers bloom?
**Things don't overlap. What a mess! He sticks his head
out from within a cave of tangled vines.*

COMMENTARY

Naturally Hsueh Tou sees that other Ancient; he only needs to
go to his lifeline, and in one spurt produces a verse for him.

Fifth

Case

35

"An ox head disappears, a horse head emerges." Tell me, what

is he saying? If you see all the way through to the bottom, it is
like eating gruel early in the morning and eating rice at
midday-just this ordinary. Out of compassion, Hsueh Tau
shatters (everything) with one hammer blow at the outset, and
settles (everything) with a single phrase. He is just undeniably
solitary and steep, like a flint-struck spark or a flash of light­
ning. He doesn't reveal his sword point; there's no place for you
to linger over. Tell me, can you search it out in your intellec­
tual faculty? These first two lines have said it all.
In the third line, instead Hsueh Tau opens a pathway and
displays a little bit of formal style-already he has fallen into
the weeds. If you produce words on top of words, phrases on top
of phrases, ideas on top of ideas, making up explanations and
interpretations, you will not only get me bogged down, but
you'll also turn your backs on Hsueh Tau. Although old man
Hsueh Tau's verse is this way, his intention is not like this. He
has never made up principles to bind people.
"In the mirror of Ts'ao Ch'i, absolutely no dust." Quite a
few people say that a stilled mind is the mirror itself. Fortu­
nately, this has nothing to do with it; if you're only concerned
with judging and comparing principles, what end will there be
to it? Hsueh Tau has spoken clearly; it's just that people do not
see. Therefore Hsueh Tau, being such a dotard, says in verse,
"He beats the drum for you to come look, but you don't see."
Do ignorant people see? He says more to you: "When spring
arrives, for whom do the hundred flowers bloom?" One could
say he's opening the doors and windows, throwing them wide
open all at once for you. When spring comes, in the hidden
valleys and wild ravines, in places where there are no people, a
hundred flowers burst forth in profusion. Tell me, who else do
they bloom for?

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

Ts'ao Ch'i was the abode of the great Sixth Patriarch of Chinese
Ch'an, Hui Neng (also known as 'workman Lu'), and is used to
refer to him, as well as to his inspiration and lineage. According to
tradition, when the Fifth Patriarch Hung Jen wanted to appoint a
successor, he told his students to each compose a verse expressing
his understanding. All deferred to the senior disciple, Shen Hsiu, a

36

man of great learning and accomplishment in discipline and
meditation. Shen Hsiu wrote,
The body is the tree of enlightenment,
The mind like a bright mirror-stand;
Time and again polish it diligently,
Do not let there be any dust.
Hui Neng, however, then a workman in the temple, composed
the following verse:
Enlightenment is basically not a tree,
And the mind-mirror not a stand;
Originally there is not a single thing­
What is the use of wiping away dust?
An alternate version has the last line, "Where is there any dust?"
Hung Jen accepted Hui Neng as his successor.

Yun Men's Every Day is a Good Day

try to say something about after the fifteenth day."2

COMMENTARY

Yun Men first called on Mu Chou. Mu Chou spun devices that
turned like lightning, so it was difficult to approach and linger.
Whenever he received someone, he would grab him as soon as
he crossed the threshold and say, "Speak! Speak!" If he
couldn't attempt a reply, he would push him out, saying,
"Antique drill turning in a rut!"
When Yun Men went to see Mu Chou, on the third time, as
soon as he knocked on the door, Mu Chou said, "Who's there?"
Yun Men answered, "(Me,) Wen Yen."a As soon as (Mu Chou)
opened the door a little, (Yun Men) immediately bounded in;
Mu Chou held him fast and said, "Speak! Speak!" Yun Men

37

38

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

hesitated, and was pushed out; he still had one foot inside
when Mu Chou slammed the door, breaking Yun Men's leg. As
Yun Men cried out in pain, he was suddenly greatly en­
lightened. Subsequently, the trend of his words in dealing with
people, his whole style, emerged from Mu Chou. After this,
Yun Men stayed for three years in the home of the ministry
president Ch'en Ts'ao."
Mu Chou directed Yun Men to go to Hsueh Feng; when he
arrived there, he came forth from the assembly and said, "What
is Buddha?" Hsueh Feng said, "Don't talk in your sleep." Yun
Men then bowed. He dwelt there for three years. One day
Hsueh Feng asked him, "What is your perception?" Yun Men
said, "My view doesn't differ in the slightest from that of all
the sages since antiquity."
For twenty years Ling Shu did not appoint a head monk. He
used to say, "My head monk is born," and "My head monk is
tending oxen," and he would say, "My head monk is traveling
on foot." Suddenly one day he ordered the bell to be struck (for
everyone to assemble) to receive the head monk at the gate.
The congregation was dubious about this, but Yun Men actu­
ally arrived. Ling Shu immediately invited him into the head
monk's quarters to unpack his bundle. People called Ling Shu
the Knowing Sage Ch'an Master, since he knew of all past and
future events in advance.
Once King Liu, the Lord of Kuang (-tung), was going to
mobilize his army; he intended to go to the monastery person­
ally to ask the master (Ling Shu) to determine whether condi­
tions were auspicious or not. Ling Shu, knowing of this be­
forehand, sat down and peacefully passed away. The Lord of
Kuang said angrily, "Since when was the master sick?" The
attendant answered, "The master hadn't been sick. He had just
entrusted a box (to me), which he ordered me to present to your
majesty when you arrived." The Lord of Kuang opened the box
and took out a card which said, "The Eye of Humans and Gods
(a living Buddha) is the head monk in the hall." Having under­
stood Ling Shu's inner meaning, the Lord of Kuang thereupon
dismissed his soldiers and invited Yun Men to appear in the
world at Ling Shu Monastery. Only later did he dwell at Yun
Men.
As the master was expounding the Dharma, the royal atten­
dant Ju posed a question; "Is the fruit of Ling Shu ('Spiritual

Sixth Case

39

Tree') ripe yet, or not?" Yun Men said, "When have you ever
heard it said that it was unripe?"
One day King Liu summoned the master to spend the sum­
mer in the palace. Together with several other venerable ab­
bots, he was to receive the questions of the courtiers and ex­
pound the Dharma. Only one man, the master Yun Men, did
not speak, and there was no one on familiar terms with him.
One of the palace functionaries wrote a verse and posted it in
the Green Jade Hall:
Cultivation of the great wisdom-only that is
Ch'an;
Silence, not clamor, is in order for the Ch'an school.
Ten thousand kinds of clever talk -how can they
be as good as reality�
They lose to Yun Men's total not speaking.

Yun Men usually liked to teach three word Ch'an:'· observ­
ing, "Reflect!" 11Ha!" He also taught one word Ch'an: a monk
asked, 11When you kill your father and mother, you repent be­
fore the Buddha; when you kill the Buddha and Patriarchs,
where do you turn to repent?" Yun Men said, 11Exposed." Again
a monk asked, 11What is the treasury of the eye of the true
Dharma?" Yun Men said, "Universal." It just doesn't allow any
attempts to explain. In ordinary situations, even, Yun Men
would still revile people. When he uttered a phrase, it was like
an iron spike.
Later Yun Men produced the Four Sages: Tung Shan Shou
Ch'u, Chih Men Shih Kuan, Te Shan Yuan Mi, and Hsiang Lin
Teng Yuan. They all were great masters of the school. Hsiang
Lin served as Yun

Men's attendant for

eighteen years;

whenever Yun Men dealt with him, he would just call out,
"Attendant Yuan!" Yuan would answer, "Yes?" Yun Men
would say, "What is it?" It went on like this for eighteen years,
when one day Hsiang Lin finally awakened. Yun Men told him,
11From now on I won't call you any more."
In Yun Men's usual dealings with people, he would often use
the methods of Mu Chou; though it was hard to approach him,
he had the hammer and tongs, to pull out nails and wrench out
pegs. Hsueh Tou said of him, "I like the fresh devices of Shao
Yang;ct he spent his life pulling out nails and pegf for people."
Yun Men set down a question to instruct his community, 11I

40

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

don't ask you about before the fifteenth day; try to say some­
thing about after the fifteenth day." He cuts off the thousand
distinctions, and doesn't let either ordinary or holy pass. He
himself answered for everyone, "Every day is a good day." The
words "before the fifteenth day" already cut off the thousand
distinctions; the words "after the fifteenth day" also cut off the
thousand distinctions. The fact is that Yun Men did not say
that the next day is the sixteenth day. People coming after him
merely followed his words to produce interpretations; but
what relevance has this? Yun Men established a protean style;
he surely had a way to benefit people. Having spoken some
words, he then answered himself in everyone's behalf: "Every
day is a good day." These words pervade past and present, from
before until after, and settle everything at once.
I too am following his words to produce interpretations
when I talk like this. Killing others is not as good as killing
yourself. As soon as you make a principle, you fall into a pit.
Three phrases are inherent in every one phrase of Yun Men;
since the source inspiration of his family is like this, when Yun
Men utters a phrase, it must be returned to the source. Any­
thing but this will always be phony. The affair has no mul­
titude of arguments and propositions, though those who have
not yet penetrated want (me as commentator) to go on like
this. If you do penetrate, then you will immediately see the
essential meaning of the Ancient.
Take a look at the complications Hsueh Tou creates:

VERSE

He throws away one,
• •

Seven openings, eight holes.

Where has it gone{ He lets up
a little.

•

Picks up seven.
• •

He can't pick them up, yet

he doesn't let them go.

•

Above, below, and in the four directions, there is no compari­
son.
•

*What's it like! Above is the sky, below is the earth.

East, west, south, north; what comparison is there�
Nevertheless, the staff is in my hand.*
Placidly walking along, he treads down the sound of the flowing stream;
**Don't ask what's right under your feet. It's difficult to
investigate it thoroughly. He's gone into the nest of en­
tangling vines.*
His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of flying birds.
**In the eye, there is no such happening. A wild
fox spirit view; as before, he's just inside the
same old den.*
The grasses grow thick,
**He pulls the arrow out of the back

He is fallen into equanimity.*
The mists overhang.
**He hasn't come out of this nest yet.
Beneath his feet clouds arise.*
'Round Subhuti's cliff, the flowers make a mess;
**Where is he� The stupid fellow! He's
been completely exposed.*
I snap my fingers;" how lamentable is Shunyata!
**The four quarters and eight directions,

Don't make a move!
**How come your previous words�

If you move, thirty blows!
**Take what's coming to you

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tau's eulogies of the Ancients were always ac­
complished like this: at first he takes the jewel sword of the
Diamond King and brings it down at once; then afterwards he

42

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

reveals a little bit of formal style. Although it's like this, ulti­
mately there are not two understandings.
"He throws away one, picks up seven." People often make
an understanding based on the numbers and say, "'He throws
away one' refers to 'before the fifteenth day'." Having abruptly
put down two lines and sealed it up, Hsueh Tou then instead
reveals it to let people see; "He throws away one, picks up
seven." You must avoid turning to the words for your subsis­
tence. Why? What moisture is there in unleavened bread?
People often fall back into conceptual consciousness. You
must obtain your understanding before the words arise; then
the great function will become manifest and you will naturally
see it.
This is why after old man Shakyamuni had attained the Path
in the land of Magadha, he spent three weeks contemplating
this matter: "The nature of all things being quiescent extinc­
tion cannot be conveyed by words; I would rather not preach
the Dharma, but quickly enter nirvana." When he got to this
point, even Shakyamuni couldn't find any way to open his
mouth. But by virtue of his power of skill in technique, after he
had preached to the five mendicants, he went to three hundred
and sixty assemblies and expounded the teachings for his age.
All these were just expedients. For this reason he had taken off
his bejewelled regal garments and put on rough dirty clothing.
He could not but turn towards the shallows within the gate of
the secondary meaning in order to lead in his various disciples.
If we had him face upwards and bring it all up at once, there
would hardly be anyone in the whole world (who could under­
stand).
But tell me, what is the supreme word? At this point Hsueh
Tou reveals a little of the meaning to let people see. Just don't
see that there are any buddhas above, don't see that there are
sentient beings below; don't see that there are mountains, riv­
ers, and earth without, and don't see that there are seeing,
hearing, discernment, or knowledge within: then you will be
like one who has died the great death and then returned to life.
With long and short, good and evil, fused into one whole,
though you bring them up one by one, you'll no longer see
them as different. After that, you'll be able to function respon­
sively without losing balance. Then you will see the meaning
of his saying, "He throws away one, picks up seven; above,

Sixth Case

43

below, and in the four directions, there is no comparison." If
you pass through at these lines, then and there above, below,
and in the four directions, there is no comparison. The myriad
forms and multitude of appearances-plants, animals, and
people-everything everywhere completely manifests the way
of your own house. Thus it was said,
Within myriad forms, only one body is revealed;
Only when one is sure for himself will he then be
near.
In past years I mistakenly turned to the road to
search;
Now I look upon it like ice within fire.
"In the heavens and on earth, I alone am the honored one."
Many people pursue the branches and don't seek the root. First
get the root right, then naturally when the wind blows the
grass bends down, naturally where water flows a stream forms.
"Placidly walking along, he treads down the sound of the
flowing stream." As he goes along placidly, he can tread down
and cut off even the roar of a vast swelling torrent. "His relaxed
gaze descries the tracks of flying birds." Even if it's the tracks
of flying birds, allow the eye one look, and it is like tracing
them out. When you get here, you will not consider it difficult
to blow out the fires under the cauldrons of hell, or to shatter
sword forests and knife mountains with a shout.
Because of his compassion, at this point Hsueh Tou feared
that people would settle down within the realm of unconcern,
so he went on to say, "The grasses grow thick, the mists over­
hang." But tell me, whose world is this? Can it be called "Every
day is a good day"? Fortunately, there's no connection. In fact,
"Placidly walking along, he treads down the sound of the flow­
ing stream" isn't it; "His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of
flying birds" isn't it either; nor is "The grasses grow thick," nor
"The mists overhang." But even something entirely different
would just be '"Round Subhuti's cliff, the flowers make a
mess." It is still necessary to tum beyond That Side. Haven't
you read how as Subhuti was sitting in silent meditation in a
cliffside cave, the gods showered down flowers to praise him.
The venerable Subhuti said, "Flowers are showering down
from the sky in praise; whose doing is this?" A god said, "I am
Indra, king of the gods." Venerable Subhuti asked, "Why are

44

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

you offering praise?" Indra said, "I esteem the Venerable One's
skill in expounding the transcendence of wisdom." Subhuti
said, "I have never spoken a single word about wisdom; why
are you offering praise?" Indra said, "You have never spoken
and I have never heard. No speaking, no hearing-this is true
wisdom." And again he caused the earth to tremble, and show­
ered down flowers.
Hsueh Tou once made up another verse about this:
The rain has passed, the clouds are shrinking, dawn
has halfway broken through;
The multiple peaks are like a drawing of blue-green
rocky crags.
Subhuti did not know how to sit upon a cliff;
He brought on the heavenly flowers and the shaking
of the earth.
When the king of gods is shaking the earth and raining down
flowers, at this point where else will you go to hide? Hsueh
Tou also said,
I fear Subhuti won't be able to escape him;

Even beyond the cosmos all is filled to the brim.
What end will he know to his frantic turmoiU
From all sides the pure wind tugs at his clothes.
Though you be clean and naked, bare and purified, totally
without fault or worry, this is still not the ultimate. In the end
though, what is? Look carefully at this quote; "I snap my fin­
gers; how lamentable is Shunyata!" The Sanskrit word
"Shunyata" in our language means the spirit of emptiness.
Empty space is her body; she has no physical body to be con­
scious of contact. When the Buddha's brilliance shines forth,
then she manifests her body. When you get to be like Shunyata,
then Hsueh Tou will rightly snap his fingers in lament.
Again Hsueh Tou says, "Don't make a move!" What's it like
when you move? (Like) sleeping with your eyes open under the
bright sun in the blue sky.

Ch'en Ts'ao was an enlightened disciple of Mu Chou and lived in
the same area.

c.

When Yun Men encountered someone, he would look at him and
say, "Reflect!" and "Ha!" (a laugh of derision or scorn); later the
word describing Yun Men's action was included by a compiler as
one of the "three words" he is supposed to have used.

d.

Shao Yang is the name of the region where Yun Men monastery
was located, and so according to the custom of referring to Ch'an
masters by the name of their abode, this is another name for Yun
Men.

e.

Snapping the fingers is used for alerting, warning, and for warding
off filth or taboo. Abiding in subjective emptiness is referred to as
intoxication in Ch'an, considered onesided, incomplete, and
narrow-minded; hence it is taboo.

SEVENTH CASE

Hui Ch'ao Asks about Buddha

POINTER

The thousand sages have not transmitted the single word be­
fore sound; if you have never seen it personally, it's as if it were
worlds away. Even if you discern it before sound and cut off the
tongues of everyone in the world, you're still not a sharp fel­
low. Therefore it is said, "The sky can't cover it; the earth can't
support it; empty space can't contain it; sun and moon can't
illumine it." Where there is no Buddha and you alone are called
the Honored One, for the first time you've amounted to some­
thing. Otherwise, if you are not yet this way, penetrate through
on the tip of a hair and release the great shining illumination;
then in all directions you will be independent and free in the
midst of phenomena; whatever you pick up, there is nothing
that's not it. But tell me, what is attained that is so extraordi­
nary?
Does everyone understand? No one knows about the sweat­
ing horses of the past; they only want to emphasize the
achievement that crowns the age. Leaving this matter aside for
the moment, what about Hsueh Tau's public case? Look into
what's written below.

COMMENTARY

Ch'an Master Fa Yen had this ability of breaking in and crash­
ing out at the same time," and also the use of this ability; thus
he could answer like this. This is what is called passing beyond
sound and form, achieving the great freedom, letting go or tak­
ing back as the occasion requires, where killing or bringing life
rests with oneself. He is undeniably extraordinary. Neverthe­
less, people from all over who deliberate over this public case
are many, and those who make intellectual interpretations to
understand it are not few. They do not realize that whenever
the Ancients handed down a word or half a phrase, it was like
sparks struck from flint, like a flash of lightning, directly open­
ing up a single straight path.
People of later times just went to the words to make up
interpretations. Some say, "Hui Ch'ao is himself Buddha; that
is why Fa Yen answered as he did." Some say, "It's much like
riding an ox searching for an ox." Some say "The asking is it."
What relevance has any of this? If you go on understanding in
this fashion, not only do you turn against yourself, but you
seriously demean that man of old.
If you want to see the whole of (Fa Yen's) device, you must
be a fellow who doesn't turn his head when struck, a fellow
with teeth like sword trees and a mouth like a blood bowl, who
knows outside the words what they refer to; then you will have
a small portion of realization. If one by one they make intellec­
tual interpretations, everyone on earth would be an exter­
minator of the Buddha's race. As for Ch'an traveller Hui
Ch'ao's awakening here, he was constantly engrossed in pene­
trating investigation; therefore under the impact of one word,
it was as if the bottom fell out of his bucket.
It's like Superintendent Tse: he had been staying in Fa Yen's
congregation, but had never asked to enter (Fa Yen's) room (for
special instruction). One day Fa Yen asked him, "Why haven't
you come to enter my room?" Tse replied, "Didn't you know,
Teacher, when I was at Ch'ing Lin's place, I had an entry." Fa
Yen said, "Try to recall it for me." Tse said, "I asked, 'What is

48

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Buddha?' Lin said, 'The Fire God comes looking for fire."' Fa
Yen said, "Good words, but I'm afraid you misunderstood. Can
you say something more for me?" Tse said, "The Fire God is in
the province of fire; he is seeking fire with fire. Likewise, I am
Buddha, yet I went on searching for Buddha." Fa Yen said,
"Sure enough, the Superintendent has misunderstood." Con­
taining his anger, Tse left the monastery and went off across
the river. Fa Yen said, "This man can be saved if he comes
back; if he doesn't return, he can't be saved." Out on the road,
Tse thought to himself, "He is the teacher of five hundred
people; how could he deceive me?" So he turned back and
again called on Fa Yen, who told him, "Just ask me and I'll
answer you." Thereupon Tse asked, "What is Buddha?" Fa Yen
said, "The Fire God comes looking for fire." At these words Tse
was greatly enlightened.
These days there are those who just put a glare in their eyes
and interpret that as understanding. As it is said, "Since this
has no wounds, don't wound it."" With this kind of public case,
those who have practiced for a long time know where it comes
down as soon as it's brought up. In the Fa Yen succession this is
called "arrowpoints meeting."c They don't employ the five
positions of prince and minister, ct or the four propositions/
they simply talk of arrowpoints meeting. The style of Fa Yen's
family is like this; one word falls and you see and immediately
directly penetrate. But if you ponder over the words, to the end
you will search without finding.
Fa Yen appeared in the world and had a congregation of five
hundred. At this time the Buddha Dharma flourished greatly.
At this time the (future) National Teacher Te Shao had spent a
long time with Su Shan, and he considered himself to have
attained Su Shan's meaning. So he had gathered together the
writings made by Su Shan in the course of his lifetime, and
a portrait of him (to symbolize his succession to Su Shan), and
led a band of followers travelling on foot. When they got to Fa
Yen's community, he himself did not go to enter the Master's
room, but just ordered his followers to go along with the others
to enter the room.
One day when Fa Yen had ascended his seat, there was a
monk who asked, "What is one drop from the fount of Ts'ao
Ch'i?" Fa Yen said, "It's one drop from the fount of Ts'ao Ch'i."
The monk was dumbfounded and withdrew; Shao, who was in

Seventh Case

49

the assembly, was suddenly greatly enlightened when he heard
this. Later he appeared in the world as one of Fa Yen's succes­
sors. Shao had a verse which he presented, saying,
The summit of the peak of the mystic crossing
Is not the human world;
Outside the mind there are no things­
Blue mountains fill the eyes.
Fa Yen gave his seal of approval and said, "This one verse alone
can perpetuate my school. In the future kings and lords will
honor you. I am not equal to you."
Look at those Ancients; when they awaken like this, what
truth is this? It won't do just to have me tell you; you yourself
must tune your spirit all day long. If you can attain fulfillment
the way these people did, then someday you will let down your
hand for people in the crossroads, and won't consider it a dif­
ficult thing, either.
Thus, when the monk asked Fa Yen, "What is Buddha?" Fa
Yen said, "You are Hui Ch'ao." Is there any contradiction here?
Haven't you read what Yun Men said-"When it is brought up,
if you don't take heed, then you'll miss it; if you try to assess it
by thinking, in what aeon will you awaken?" Hsueh Tou sub­
sequently versified it with unmistakable clarity. I'll bring it up:
Look!

VERSE

In the river country the spring wind isn't blowing;
**Where in the world do you find this scene�
The pattern is already showing.*
Deep within the flowers partridges are calling.
**What's the use of this chatter� He is
blown by the wind into a different tune.
How can there be such a thing�*
At the three-tiered Dragon Gate, where the waves are high,
fish become dragons,
**Traverse this one road. Don't fool the great congrega­
tion. Tread upon the dragon's head.*

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou is an adept: where the Ancients are hard to gnaw on
and hard to chew, hard to penetrate and hard to see, an im­
penetrable riddle, he produces it in verse to let people see. He is
indeed extraordinary. Hsueh Tou knew Fa Yen's key device,
and he also knew where Hui Ch'ao was at. Still, he feared that
people in the future would turn to Fa Yen's words and mistak­
enly conceive an understanding, so he came out with this
verse.
This monk's asking like this, Fa Yen's answering like
this-this is "In the river country the spring wind isn't blow­
ing; deep within the flowers partridges are calling." These two
lines are just one line. But say, where is Hsueh Tou's meaning?
In Kiangsi and Chiangnan many people make a two-part
interpretation; they say that "In the river country the spring
wind isn't blowing" is used to versify "You are Hui Ch'ao."
(They say that) this scene-even if the spring wind doesn't
blow in the river country, still "deep within the flowers par­
tridges are calling"-is used to compare the endless haggling
over these words everywhere to the partridges crying deep in
the flowers. But what relevance has this? How far they are from
knowing that these two lines of Hsueh Tou's are but a single
line. Do you want to have no seam or gap? Clearly I tell you,
his speech is to the point, his words are to the point; they cover
heaven and earth.
(Hui Ch'ao) asked, "What is Buddha?" Fa Yen answered,
"You are Hui Ch'ao." Hsueh Tou says, "In the river country
the spring wind isn't blowing; deep within the flowers par­
tridges call." If you can make the grade here, you will be able to
walk alone through the red skies; if you make intellectual in­
terpretations, (you'll go on through) past, present, and future
lives for sixty aeons.
Hsueh Tou is extremely compassionate in the third and

Seventh Case

51

fourth lines; all at once he explains completely for people.
Ch'an Master Ch'ao's great awakening is likened to fish be­
coming dragons where the waves are high at the three-tiered
Dragon Gate, while fools still go on dragging through evening
pond water. (The Dragon Gate is a gorge through which the
Yellow River passes at the border of Shensi and Shansi; accord­
ing to tradition,) King Yu cut it (through the mountains) form­
ing a three-level (passage for the river). Nowadays, on the third
day of the third month, when the peach blossoms bloom, and
heaven and earth are ready, if there is a fish that can get
through the Dragon Gate, horns sprout on his head, he raises
his bristling tail, catches hold of a cloud, and flies away. Those
who cannot leap through fail and fall back.; Fools who gnaw on
the words are like scooping out the evening pond water looking
for fish; how little they realize that the fish have already turned
into dragons! Old Master Tuan had a verse which said,
A copper of bright money
Buys a fried cake;
He gobbles it down into his belly,
And from then on no longer feels hunger.

This verse is very good, only it's too crude. Hsueh Tou's verse
is very clever, and he doesn't cut his hand on its sharp point.
In the old days Librarian Ch'ing liked to ask people, "What
is 'Fish turn into dragons at three-tiered Dragon Gate where
the waves are high'?" For me, it's not necessary, but now I'm
asking you: having turned into a dragon, where is he now?

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

Breaking in and crashing out at the same time symbolizes the
action of the teacher and student encounter: the student is
likened to a chick still inside the shell of his ego, trying to crash
its way out, while the teacher, as the 'parent,' breaks through
from the outside to help the chick out. See the sixteenth case.

This saying is taken from the Vimalakirtinirdesa scripture, in
which context it should be read, "Since they have no wounds,
don't wound them," meaning that the lesser vehicle of revulsion
should not be taught to those who have the capacity for the
greater vehicle of tolerance. We have not used "they" because of

the preceding sentence in the context; "they" would cause confu­
sion here. Yuan Wu's intent seems to be don't impute any flaw to
the flawless Buddha-essence by intellectual, emotional interpre­
tations. Tenkei Denson says, "Fa Yen's answer 'You're Hui
Ch'ao/ breaking in and crashing out at the same time, has no gap
or flaw, so don't you people ruin it with intellectual judgements."
c.

This represents question and answer meeting, like two arrows

This was an illustrative device of the Ts'ao-Tung tradition of
Ch'an: the Prince, or Lord, symbolizes emptiness, while the
Minister, or Vassal, symbolizes the world of matter, or form. The
five positions are: minister turning towards prince (emptiness
within matterL prince looking at minister (matter within empti­
ness), prince alone (emptiness as such), minister alone (matter as
such), and prince and minister in harmony (simultaneous inter­
identification of emptiness and matter).

e.

This was a device of the Lin Chi tradition of Ch'an: the four prop­
ositions involve conceding or taking away person and/or environ­
ment, taking away the person but not the environment, taking
away the environment but not the person, taking away both, and
leaving both. See the appendix, "Traditional Teaching Devices."

This refers to a story of a man who saw a running rabbit happen to
collide with a tree stump and die; the man took the rabbit for
food, and, thinking to obtain another rabbit; he foolishly stood by
the stump, waiting for it to 'catch' another rabbit for him. This is
used to describe those who cling to words or images, thinking
them to be a source of enlightenment.

This simile of passing through the Dragon Gate was also used to
refer to the Chinese civil service examinations; those who passed
could become government officials.

EIGHTH CASE

Ts'ui Yen's Eyebrows

POINTER

If you understand, you can make use of it on the road, like a
dragon reaching the water, like a tiger in the mountains. If you
don't understand, then the worldly truth will prevail, and you
will be like a ram caught in a fence, like (a fool) watching over a
stump waiting for a rabbit. Sometimes a single phrase is like a
lion crouching on the ground; sometimes a phrase is like the
Diamond King's jewel sword. Sometimes a phrase cuts off the
tongues of everyone on earth, and sometimes a phrase follows
the waves and pursues the currents.
If you make use of it on the road, when you meet with a man
of knowledge you distinguish what's appropriate to the occa­
sion, you know what's right and what's wrong, and together
you witness each other's illumination. Where the worldly
truth prevails, one who has the single eye can cut off every­
thing in the ten directions and stand like a mile high wall.
Therefore it is said, "When the great function appears it does
not keep to any fixed standards." Sometimes we take a blade of
grass and use it as the sixteen foot golden body (of Buddha);
sometimes we take the sixteen foot golden body and use it as a
blade of grass. But tell me, what principle does this depend
upon? Do you really know? To test, I cite this; Look!

COMMENTARY

The Ancients had morning study and evening inquiry; at the
end of the summer retreat Ts'ui Yen turned around and spoke
to the community like this, and he was undeniably solitary and
steep-nothing could stop him from startling the heavens and
shaking the earth. But tell me, in the whole great treasury of
teachings, in the five thousand and forty-eight volumes of the
canon, whether they talk of mind or nature, whether they
preach the sudden or the gradual, has there ever been this hap­
pening? They're all this kind of occasion, but among them
Ts'ui Yen is outstanding. Look at the way he talks; tell me,
where is his true meaning?
When the Ancients let down a hook, it was never an empty
manoeuvre; they invariably had some truth to benefit people.
Many people misunderstand and say, "Under the bright sun in
the blue sky, Ts'ui Yen spoke aimless talk producing concern
where there was none; at the end of the summer he spoke of his
own faults and examined himself first to avoid others criticiz­
ing him." Fortunately this has nothing to do with it. Such
views are called exterminators of the Buddha's race. The ap­
pearance in the world of the successive generations of teaching
masters would have been entirely without benefit if they
hadn't reached down to instruct people. What would have been
the purpose? When you get here, if you can see all the way
through, then you will know that the Ancients had the method
to drive off a plowman's ox and to snatch away a hungry man's
food.

Eighth Case

55

People today, when questioned, immediately tum to the
words to chew on them, making a living on Ts'ui Yen's eye­
brows. Look at how the people of his house naturally know
where he is operating: through a thousand changes and ten
thousand transformations,

amidst impenetrable complica­

tions, everywhere they have ways to show themselves; hence
they are able to chime in with him like this in response. If
there is nothing extraordinary about these words of Ts'ui
Yen's, why then would these three men, Yun Men, Pao Fu, and
Ch'ang Ch'ing, have replied to him so profusely?
Pao Fu said, "The thief's heart is cowardly." How much
intellectual interpretation these words have provoked lately!
But say, what about Pao Fu's meaning? You must avoid search­
ing for that Ancient in his words. If you give rise to feelings and
arouse your thoughts, then he'll snatch your eyeballs away.
Above all, people don't realize that when Pao Fu utters one
turning word, he cuts off Ts'ui Yen's footsteps.
Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "Grown." Many people say, "Ch'ang
Ch'ing turns along following Ts'ui Yen's footsteps, therefore
he says (that Ts'ui Yen's eyebrows have) grown." But this has
nothing to do with it. They don't know that Ch'ang Ch'ing
brings out his own view when he says, "Grown." Each has a
place to appear in person, but I ask you, where is the growth?
It's just like being face to face with an adept brandishing the
Diamond King's jewel sword. If you can smash the views of the
ordinary current and cut off gain and loss, affirmation and ne­
gation, then you will see where Ch'ang Ch'ing responded to
Ts'ui Yen.
Yun Men said, "A barrier." This is undeniably outstanding,
but hard to penetrate. The great master Yun Men often taught
people with one word Ch'an, though in the one word the three
phrases were always present. Look how this Ancient replied to
suit the occasion; naturally he was far removed from the
people of this day and age. This then is the way to utter a
phrase. Although Yun Men spoke like this, his meaning is
definitely not here. Since the meaning is not here, tell me,
where is it? If you are a clear eyed man with the ability to illu­
mine heaven and earth, just be crystal clear in every respect.
For his single word "barrier" and the words of the other three,
Hsueh Tou has strung them together in one verse:

56

Ts'ui Yen teaches the followers;
**The old thief! He's corrupting
other people's children.*
For a thousand ages, there is no reply.

divides a tally. *
The word "barrier" answers him back;
**Didn't you believe what I said�
He is undeniably extraordinary.

COMMENTARY

How could Hsueh Tou be called a Good Friend if he hadn't
been this compassionate, making a verse to enable people to
see? When the Ancients acted like this, it was all something
they couldn't but do. Because later students become attached
to their words and more and more give rise to intellectual
interpretations, therefore they do not see the Ancients' mes­
sage. If someone suddenly came forward right now to overturn
the meditation seat and scatter the great assembly with shouts,
we shouldn't be amazed at him. Though someone acted like
this, you yourself would still have to really arrive in this realm
in order to attain this.
When Hsueh Tou says, "For a thousand ages there is no
reply," he is just telling you to see if Ts'ui Yen's eyebrows are
there What's so extraordinary that there is no reply for a
thousand ages? You must realize that when the Ancients spat
out a word or half a phrase, it wasn't blurted out; one must
have the eye to judge heaven and earth before this is possible.
When Hsueh Tou writes a word or half a phrase it's like the
Diamond King's jewel sword, like a lion crouching on the
ground, like sparks struck from stone, like the brilliance of a
lightning flash. If he didn't have the eye on his forehead, how
could he have seen where that man of old (Ts'ui Yen) comes
down? This lesson that Ts'ui Yen gave the people was such
that "for a thousand ages there is no reply." It goes beyond Te
Shan's staff and Lin Chi's shout. But say, where is Hsueh Tau's
meaning for us? And how ·will you understand his statement,
"For a thousand ages there is no reply"?
"The word 'barrier' answers him back; he loses his money
and suffers punishment." What is the meaning of this? Even if

58

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

you have the eye to pass through the barrier, when you get here
you still must be most thoroughgoing before you are done. Tell
me, is it Ts'ui Yen who loses his money and suffers punish­
ment, or is it Hsueh Tou, or is it Yun Men? If you can penetrate
this, I'll allow that you have the eye.
"Decrepit old Pao Fu; censure or praise are impossible to
apply." Does he censure himself? Does he praise the Ancients?
Tell me, where does Pao Fu censure? Where does Pao Fu praise?
"Talkative Ts'ui Yen is clearly a thief." Tell me, what has
he stolen, that Hsueh Tou says he's a thief? You must avoid
being whirled around following after the stream of his words;
when you get here you must have your own accomplishment
before you'll understand.
"The clear jewel has no flaws." Hsueh Tou says that Ts'ui
Yen is like a clear jewel without any flaws or cloudy patches.
"Who can distinguish true from false?" It can be said that
rarely is there anyone who can make this distinction.
Hsueh Tou has great talent, so he can string together the
whole case from beginning to end on the single thread of this
verse. Only at the very end does he then say, "Ch'ang Ch'ing
knows him well; his eyebrows are grown." Tell me, where are
they growing? Hurry up, take a look!

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

Teaching is said to be an act of 'facing downwards' since the
transcendental cannot be spoken of directly; hence it is said in
Ch'an that if one speaks too much, tries to explain too much, his
eyebrows may fall out. Similarly, when one has, so to speak, 'Said
everything,' it is said that he isn't anxious for, or does not spare,
his eyebrows.

b.

That is to say, he loses the bribe money he has offered, and suffers
the punishment he was due anyway. This is a common phrase in
Ch'an.

NINTH CASE

Chao Chou's Four Gatesa

POINTER

When the bright mirror is on its stand, beauty and ugliness are
distinguished by themselves. With a sharp sword in his hand,
one can kill or bring life to fit the occasion. A foreigner goes
and a native comes; a foreigner comes and a native goes. In the
midst of death he finds life; in the midst of life he finds death.
But tell me, when you get to this point, then what? If you don't
have the eye to penetrate barriers, if you don't have any place
to turn yourself around in, at this point obviously you won't
know what to do. Tell me, what is the eye that penetrates
barriers, what is a place to turn around in? To test, I cite this;
look!

60

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

When you immerse yourself in meditation and inquire about
the Path, it is in order to clearly understand yourself; just avoid
picking and choosing among verbal formulations. Why?
Haven't you read what Chao Chou said-"The ultimate path
has no difficulties; just avoid picking and choosing." And
haven't you read what Yun Men said-"These days whenever
followers of Ch'an gather in threes and fives their mouths chat­
ter on and on; they say 'these are words of high ability, those
are words uttered in reference to the self."' They don't realize
that within the gate of expedient means the Ancients couldn't
help but establish expedient verbal formulae for latecoming
students of elementary capacities who had not yet clarified
their mind ground nor seen their fundamental nature. In the
Patriarch's coming from the West for the sole transmission of
the mind seal, directly pointing to the human mind for the per­
ception of nature and fulfillment of Buddhahood, where were
there any such complications? It is necessary to cut off words,
to see the truth outside of any pattern. When you penetrate
through to liberation, this can be compared to a dragon reach­
ing the water or a tiger at home in the mountains.
To have seen but not yet penetrated, or to have penetrated
but not yet become illumined-among the worthies of the past
who investigated for so long, this was called seeking more in­
struction. To ask for more instruction when you have seen and
penetrated, you then must still turn round and round on the
words so there will be no doubtful sticking points. When one
who has investigated for a long time asked for more instruc­
tion, this would be giving a ladder to a thief. In reality this
matter does not lie in words; that is why Yun Men said, "If this
matter were in words, are there no words in the twelve part
canon of the three vehicles? What need would there have been
for Bodhidharma's coming from the West?"
Within Fen Yang's eighteen categories of questions, b this
question (in the case) is called a question to examine the host;
it's also called a seeking out question. The monk posing this
question is undeniably extraordinary; anyone but Chao Chou
would have found it hard to reply to him. The monk asked,
"What is Chao Chou?" Chao Chou is an adept in his own right,
so he immediately replied, "East gate, west gate, south gate,

Ninth Case

61

north gate." The monk said, "I wasn't asking about that Chao
Chou." Chao Chou said, "What Chao Chou were you asking
about?"
Later people said this was "no-nothing Ch'an" cheating
quite a few people. What was their reason? When the monk
asked about Chao Chou, Chao Chou answered, "East gate,
west gate, south gate, north gate"; therefore (these people say)
he was just answering about the other Chao Chou (i.e. the city).
If you understand in this fashion, then any rustic from a village
of three families understands more about the Buddha Dharma
than you do. Such an interpretation destroys the Buddha
Dharma. It's like comparing a fish eye to a bright pearl; in
appearance they are alike, but actually they are not the same.
As I said, if it's not south of the river, then it's north of the
river. But say, is there something or is there nothing? This does
indeed require you to be thoroughgoing before you understand.
Yuan "The Jurist"'" said, "The very last word finally reaches
the closed barrier; the inner essence of pointing out the Way is
not in words and explanations:
In ten days, one breeze;
In five days, one rain.
In the peaceful countryside enjoying their tasks,
Drumming their full bellies and singing hallelujah."

This is called the season of great peace. When I call this having
no concerns, it is not a matter of covering your eyes with your
hands and saying "I have no concerns." You must penetrate
through the barrier, emerge from the forest of brambles, clean
and naked, bare and untrammelled: as before you will resemble
any ordinary person, but now it's all right whether there is
anything of concern or there is nothing; it's up to you. Free in
all directions, you will never cling to nothingness and establish
it as something.
Some people say, "Fundamentally there isn't the slightest
bit of anything, but when we have tea we drink tea, and when
we have rice we eat rice." This is big vain talk; I call this
claiming attainment without having attained, claiming reali­
zation without having realized. Basically since they haven't
bored in and penetrated through, when they hear people speak­
ing of mind or nature, of the mysterious or the abstruse, they

62

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

say, "This is just mad talk; fundamentally there isn't anything
to be concerned with." This could be called one blind man
leading many blind men. They are far from knowing that be­
fore the Patriarch came, people scarcely called the sky earth, or
called mountains rivers; why did the Patriarch still come from
the West? Everyplace where they "go up into the hall'"1 and
"enter the room"e what do they speak of? It is all judgements of
intellectual consciousness; when the feelings of judgements of
intellectual consciousness are ended, only then can you see
through. And when you see through, then as of old sky is sky,
earth is earth, mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers.
An Ancient said, "Mind is the sense faculty, things are the
objects; both elements are like flaws on a mirror." When you
get to this realm you will naturally be clean and naked, bare
and untrammelled. Even the ultimate principle of theory is not
yet the place of peace and security. People often misunderstand
this point; they stay within the realm of unconcern and neither
pay homage to the Buddhas nor burn incense. They do indeed
seem to be right, but in spite of that they're totally wrong.
When questioned, their replies do resemble the ultimate prin­
ciple, but as soon as they are pressed, they're shattered, con­
fused; they sit there with an empty belly and a proud heart, but
when they get to their last day they'll wring their hands and
beat their breasts, but it'll already be too late.
This monk asked this way, Chao Chou answered this way;
tell me, how will you look for them? This way won't do, not
this way won't do either; ultimately, how is it? This bit is a
hard one, so Hsueh Tou has brought it out in front of you to
show you people.
One day while Chao Chou was sitting, his attendant re­
ported to him, "The great king has come." Chao Chou looked
surprised and said, "Myriad felicitations, 0 great king!" The
attendant said, "He has not yet come to you, Master." Chao
Chou said, "And you said he's come." He penetrated this far,
he saw this far; undeniably extraordinary. Ch'an Master Hui
Nan of Huang Lung commented on this, saying,

The attendant only knew how to announce a guest,
He did not know that be himself was in the impe­
rial city.

COMMENTARY

Chao Chou faces situations just like the Diamond King's jewel
sword: hesitate, and immediately he cuts your head off; time
and time again he will go on and snatch your eyeballs right
away. Nevertheless, this monk dares to grab the tiger's whisk­
ers and pose a question. It's like giving rise to something
where there's nothing; yet nevertheless in his words there is
ability. Once the monk had shown his ability, Chao Chou did
not tum his back on his question; thus he too showed his
ability in answering. It wasn't that he acted like this out of
whimsy; because he was a man who had penetrated through,

64

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

naturally he fit in the same groove with the monk, as if it were
all arranged.
Haven't you heard? There was an outsider who came to
question the World Honored One holding a sparrow in his
hand. He said, "Tell me, is this sparrow in my hand dead or
alive?" The World Honored One then went and straddled the
threshold and said, "You tell me, am I going out or coming in?"
(One version has it that the World Honored One raised his fist
and asked, "Open or closed?") The outsider was speechless;
then he bowed in homage. This story is just like the main case;
ever since then the bloodline of the Ancients has been unbro­
ken. Thus it is said, "The question is where the answer is, the
answer is where the question is."
Since Hsueh Tau can see through things like this, he says,
"In their words they show their ability in direct confronta­
tion." There is skill in the monk's words, which seem to bear
two meanings; he seems to ask about the man and he also
seems to ask about the place. Without stirring a single
hairsbreadth Chao Chou immediately replies to him, "East
gate, west gate, south gate, north gate."
"The Adamantine Eye is completely void of dust." This
praises Chao Chou snatching away both person and environ­
ment, and in his words showing his ability, giving him an
answer. This is called having ability, having perspective. The
moment the monk turns around, Chao Chou sees through his
innermost heart. If he couldn't do this, it would have been
difficult for Chao Chou to parry the monk's question. Chakrar
Eye is a Sanskrit expression that means an adamantine eye, a
diamond eye, which illumines and sees everywhere without
obstruction. Not only can it clearly make out a tiny hair a
thousand miles away, but also it can determine what's false
and decide what's true, distinguish gain and loss, discern
what's appropriate to the occasion, and recognize right and
wrong.
Hsueh Tou says, "East, west, south, north-the gates face
each other; an endless series of hammer blows can't smash
them open." Since the hammer blows continue without limit,
why can't they smash the gates open? It's that Hsueh Tau's
vision is like this. How will all of you people get these gates
open? Please examine this thoroughly.

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

Chao Chou was the name of the city and the province where the
Ch'an master Ts'ung Shen lived, and is hence the name by which
he is usually known, according to Ch'an custom.

b.

Fen Yang Shan Ch'ao (947 -1024), a great master of the Lin Chi
sect, commented on many of the devices of earlier Ch'an masters
and attempted to synthesize the teachings of the various Ch'an
sects; for an enumeration of his 'eighteen questions,' see the ap­
pendix, "Traditional Teaching Devices."

c.

Fu Shan Fa Y uan (10-11c.) was accredited by several masters, in­
cluding Fen Y ang; his nickname 'The Jurist' was on account of his
great knowledge of history and legal cases, which he once had to
display to free himself and his traveling companions from the
clutches of a corrupt magistrate in western China.

d.

This refers to masters addressing students in the teaching hall.

e.

This refers to masters interviewing disciples in the master's

f.

Chakra in Sanskrit actually means wheel or disc, whence it
means a disc-shaped weapon, especially that of Vishnu, the main­
tainer in

Hindu cosmology. The sense

of

adamantine,

or

diamond-like, in which it is used here, is a common Ch'an
metaphor for wisdom which cuts through all obscurity and con­
fusion, like 'the jewel sword of the Diamond King.' As the de­
stroyer of all opinion and doubt, the image of the weapon cutting
through fits in with this usage. The diamond is also used in clas­
sical Buddhist metaphor to symbolize the ultimate meditative
concentration, which nothing can destroy, whence emerges the
sharp wisdom whose function cuts off all afflictions, removes all
obstacles to knowledge of things as they are.

Mu Chou's Thieving Phoney

POINTER

So, so; not so, not so. In battle, each occupies a pivotal position.
That is why it is said, "If you turn upwards, then even
Shakyamuni, Maitreya, Manjusri, Samantabhadra, and the
myriad sages, together with all the masters in the world, all
suck in their breath and swallow their voices: if you turn
downwards, worms and maggots and everything that crawls,
all sentient beings, each and every one emits great shining
light, each and every one towers like a wall miles high." If, on
the other hand, you neither face upwards nor downwards, how
would you deal? If there is a principle, go by the principle; if
there is no principle, go by the example. To test, I cite this;
look!

Mu Chou asked a monk, "Where have you just come from?"1
The monk immediately shouted.2 Mu Chou said, "I've been
shouted at by you once."3 Again the monk shouted.4 Mu Chou

nothing to say. 6 Mu Chou then hit him and said, 7 "What a
thieving phoney you are! "8

If we let Mu Chou carry out his mandate to the full, then all the
plants and trees on earth would be cut into three pieces.

He lets go the first move and falls back into the secondary.

COMMENTARY

Whoever would uphold and establish the teaching of our
school must have the eye of a true master of our school, and
must have the functional ability of a true master of our school.
Mu Chou's mental acuity is like a flash of lightening. He liked
to put lecturersa to the test; he would usually utter a word or
half a phrase like a thicket of brambles that can't be stepped on
or touched. As soon as he saw a monk coming, he would say,
"The case is complete; I let you have thirty blows of the staff."
Or he would see a monk and call out "Elder!" If the monk
turned his head, Mu Chou would say, "You board-carrying fel­
low!" Again, when he was teaching his community, he would
say, "If you don't have a place to enter, b you must find a place
to enter; once you have gained entry, you still must not turn
your backs on me." Mu Chou's efforts for people were mostly
like this.
This monk was also well polished and prepared,

but

nevertheless he had a dragon's head but a snake's tail. At the
time anyone but Mu Chou would have been thrown into con­
fusion by this monk. Like when Mu Chou asked him, "Where
have you just come from?" and the monk immediately
shouted: tell me, what was his meaning? The old fellow wasn't
at all flustered; calmly he replied, "I've been shouted at by you
once." He seems to take that shout and put it to one side, and
he also seems to test him; he leans over to see how he is. Again
the monk shouted; he seems to be right, but isn't yet really
right-his nostrils were pierced by the old fellow, who im­
mediately asked, "After three or four shouts, then what?" After
all, this monk was speechless. Mu Chou then hit him and said,
"What a thieving phoney you are!"
The aim of testing people is to know them intimately the

68

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

minute they open their mouths. Too bad this monk was
speechless, provoking Mu Chou to call him a thieving phoney.
If it had been any of you people who had been asked by Mu
Chou,

11

After three or four shouts, then what?" how should you

have replied in order to avoid his calling you a thieving
phoney? Here if you can discern survival and destruction and
distinguish right and wrong, if your feet tread the ground of
reality, then who is concerned with 11After three or four shouts,
then what?"? But since this monk was speechless, his case was
decided by old Mu Chou on the basis of the facts.
Listen to Hsueh Tau's verse:

VERSE

Two shouts and a third shout:"
**The sound of thunder is tremendous,
but there isn't even a drop of rain.
From ancient times up till now, there's
rarely been anyone like this.*
Adepts recognize the opportune moment to change.
**If he weren't an adept, how could (Mu Chou)
have tested (the monk)? I'm just afraid that
you aren't this way.*
If you call that riding the tiger's head,
** Unh! Blind man! How can you ride
a tiger's head? Quite a few people
have understood in this way, and there
are still people who entertain this view.*
The two of them would both turn out to be blind men.
**An intimate comment from the mouth of an intimate.
Why only two? Take what's coming to you and get out!*
Who is a blind man?
**Who would you have decide?
Fortunately there is a last word:
(Hsueh Tou) is on the verge of
cheating people completely. *
I bring it out for everyone to see.
**When you look, it's not that it's

Tenth Case

not there, but if you stare at it,
you'll go blind. If you set your eyes
to look, then you are grabbing empty space
with both hands. When you bring it up this
way, what level of activity is itt*

COMMENTARY

Nothing can prevent Hsueh Tou from being able to help
people. If he weren't an adept, he would just be shouting wildly
at random. Therefore it is said, "Sometimes a shout isn't used
as a shout; then again, sometimes a shout is used as a shout.
Sometimes a shout is like a lion crouching on the ground;
sometimes a shout is like the Diamond King's jewel sword."
Hsing Hua said, "I see all of you shouting in the east hall and
shouting in the west hall. Don't shout at random. Even if you
shout me up to the heavens, break me to pieces, and I fall back
down again without even a trace of breath left in me, wait for
me to revive and I'll tell you it's still not enough. Why? I have
never set out real pearls for you inside the Purple Curtains. As
for all of you here, what are you doing when you just go on with
wild random shouting?"
Lin Chi said, "I've heard all of you imitate my shouting. But
I ask you, if a monk comes from the east hall and another
monk comes from the west hall, and they both shout at once,
which one is the guest and which one is the host? If you can't
distinguish host and guest, then you must not imitate me any
more after this."
Therefore Hsueh Tou says in his verse, "Adepts recognize
the opportune moment to change." Although the monk in the
case was taken in by Mu Chou, still he could perceive the
opportune moment to change. Tell me, where did he do this?
Ch'an Master Chih of the Deer Gate graded this monk by say­
ing, "One who knows the Law fears it." Yen T'ou said, "In
battle, each man occupies a pivotal position." Master Hsin of
Huang Lung said, "When you reach an impasse, change; having
changed, then you get through." This is where the patriarchs
cut off the tongues of everyone in the world. If you recognize
the opportune moment to change, then when something is
raised, you immediately know what it comes down to.

70

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Some people say, "Why worry about Mu Chou saying, 'After
three or four shouts, then what?'?" and just go on shouting. Let
them give twenty or thirty shouts, even go on shouting until
Maitreya (the future Buddha) comes down to be born, and call
this riding the tiger's head: if you understand in this fashion,
it's because you don't know Mu Chou. Even if you want to see
the monk, you're still too far away. To ride a tiger's head one
must have a sword in his hand and versatility too before he can
succeed.
Hsueh Tau says, if you call this riding the tiger's head, "The
two of them would both tum out to be blind men." Hsueh Tau
is like a long sword leaning against the sky, stem and awesome
in full majesty. If you understand Hsueh Tau's meaning, you
will naturally understand everything at once. Then you will
see that the latter part of Hsueh Tau's verse is just making
footnotes.
Hsueh Tau goes on to say "Who is a blind man?" Tell me, is
it the guest who's blind, or is it the host who's blind? Aren't
guest and host both blind at the same time? "I bring it out for
everyone to see." This is the living place, where Hsueh Tau
finishes the verse all at once. Yet why does he say, "I bring it
out for everyone to see"? Tell me, how will you see it? Open
your eyes and you can; shut your eyes and you can too. Is there
anyone who can avoid it?

These were professor-monks of the scholastic schools, specializ­

They are sometimes derided in Ch'an literature for being too at­

A place to enter the Path; this is the true initiation, disentangle­

the state of quiescence and nothingness, so to speak, to go beyond
the point of entry and absorption into the Path, and bring out the
active function of illumination. As an Ancient said, "A sage has
no self, but there is nothing that is not his self." Although the

Huang Po's Gobblers of Dregs

POINTER

The great capacity of Buddhas and Patriarchs is completely
within his control; the lifeline of humans and gods is entirely
subject to his direction. With a casual word or phrase he as­
tounds the crowd and stirs the masses; with one device, one
object, he smashes chains and knocks off fetters. Meeting
transcendental potential, he brings up transcendental matters.
But tell me, who has ever come on like this? Are there any who
know where he is at? To test, I cite this: look!

CASE

Huang Po, instructing the community, said,1 "All of you
people are gobblers of dregs; if you go on travelling around this
way,2 where will you have Today?3 Do you know that there are
no teachers of Ch'an in all of China?"4
At that time a monk came forward and said, "Then what
about those in various places who order followers and lead
communities? "5
Huang Po said, "I do not say that there is no Ch'an; it's just
that there are no teachers. "6

COMMENTARY

Huang Po was seven feet tall; on his forehead there was (a lump
like) a round pearl. He understood Ch'an by nature. It's also
said that he once travelled in the company of a saint: once
when the master was travelling to Mount T'ien T'ai, he met a
monk on the way. They talked and laughed together like old
acquaintances. Huang Po looked him over carefully; the light
in his eyes pierced people, and his appearance was extremely
unusual. As they thus travelled along together, when they
came to a swollen valley stream, Huang Po planted his staff (in
the ground), took off his hat, and stopped there. The other
monk tried to take the master across with him, but the master
said, "Please cross over yourself." The other one then gathered
up his robes and walked upon the waves as though treading on
level ground. He looked back and said, "Come across! Come
across!" The master upbraided him, saying, "You self-perfected
fellow! If I had known you would concoct wonders, I would
have broken your legs!" The other monk sighed in admiration
and said, "You are a true vessel of the teaching of the Great
Vehicle." As his words ended, he disappeared.
When Huang Po first met Pai Chang, Pai Chang said, "Mag­
nificent! Imposing! Where have you come from?" Huang Po
said, "Magnificent and imposing, I've come from the moun­
tains." Pai Chang asked, "What have you come for?" Huang
Po said, "Not for anything else." Pai Chang esteemed him
deeply as a vessel (of Dharma).
The next day he took leave of Pai Chang. Pai Chang asked,
"Where are you going?" Huang Po replied, "To Kiangsi to pay
my respects to the Great Master Ma." Pai Chang said, "The
Great Master Ma has already passed on." Huang Po asked,
"What did he have to say when he was alive?" Pai Chang then
related the circumstances of his second encounter with Ma
Tsu:

74

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"When Ma Tsu saw me approach, he raised his whisk. I
asked, 'Do you identify with this action or detach from this
action?' Ma Tsu then hung the whisk on the corner of the
meditation seat. There was a long silence; then Ma Tsu asked
me, 'Later on, when you're flapping your lips, how will you
help people?' I took the whisk and held it up. Ma Tsu said, 'Do
you identify with this action or detach from this action?' I took
the whisk and hung it back on the corner of the meditation
seat. Ma Tsu drew himself up and gave a shout that left me deaf
for three days."
Huang Po unconsciously stuck out his tongue in awe. Pai
Chang said, "After this, won't you be a successor of the Great
Master Ma?" Huang Po said, "No. Today, because of the mas­
ter's recital, I've gotten to see the Great Master Ma's great
capacity and its great function; but if I were to succeed to
Master Ma, in the future I would be bereft of descendants." Pai
Chang said, "It is so, it is so. If your view equals your teacher,
you have less than half your teacher's virtue; only when your
wisdom goes beyond your teacher are you worthy to pass on
the transmission. As your view is right now, it seems that you
have ability which transcends any teacher." You must see for
yourself how father and son act in that house before you begin
to understand.
Again one day Huang Po asked Pai Chang, "How has the
vehicle of the school that comes down from ancient times been
demonstrated and taught?" Pai Chang was silent for a long
time; Huang Po said, "You shouldn't let posterity be cut off."
Pai Chang said, "I thought you were the man." Then he got up
and went into his abbot's quarters.
Huang Po was an informal friend of prime minister P'ei
Hsiu; he explained the essence of mind" to him. When P'ei was
commander of Wan Ling, he invited the master to come to the
district capital. He showed the master a book (expressing) his
understanding. The master took the book and put it down on
the seat without even opening it to look through it. After a long
silence, the master asked, "Do you understand?" P'ei said, "I
don't understand." Huang Po said, "If you had understood this
way, you still would have gotten somewhere; if you're still
trying to describe it with paper and ink, where would there still
be room for my school?" At this P'ei offered a verse of praise:

Eleventh Case

75

From the great man he has inherited the mind seal;
There's a round jewel on his forehead, his body is
seven feet tall.
He hung up his staff and stayed ten years by the
River Shu;
Today his floating coracle has crossed to the banks
of the Chang.
Eight thousand dragons and elephants follow his
giant strides;
Over ten thousand miles fragrant flowers join in his
excellent cause.
I hope to serve the master as his disciple;
I do not know to whom he will entrust his teaching.

The master made no sign of being pleased, but said, h
My mind is like the boundlessness of the great
ocean;
My mouth spews red lotuses to nurse a sick body.
I myself have a pair of hands with nothing to do;
I have never received an idle man.

After Huang Po was dwelling (in a temple as a teacher), his
active edge was sharp and dangerous. When Lin Chi was in his
community, Mu Chou was the head monk. (Mu Chou) asked
(Lin Chi), "How long have you been here? Why don't you go ask
(Huang Po) a question?" Chi said, "What would you have me
ask?" The head monk said, "Why don't you go ask what is the
essential meaning of the Buddha Dharma?" Chi then went and
asked (Huang Po); three times he was beaten and driven out.
He took leave of the head monk, saying, "I have been bidden to
ask the question three times by you, and have been beaten and
driven out. Perhaps my affinity is not here; for now I will leave
the mountain." The head monk said, "If you're going, you
should bid farewell to the master (Huang Po) first." The head
monk went beforehand and said to Huang Po, "The question­
ing monk is a very rare one; why don't you work on him to
make him into a tree to provide cool shade for people of later
times?" Huang Po said, "I already know."
When Chi came to take leave, Po said, "You don't need to go
anyplace else; just go to the riverbank at Ta An and see Ta Yu."

76

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

When Chi got to Ta Yu, he related the preceding story and said,
"I do not know where my fault was." Ta Yu said, "Huang Po
was so kind, he exerted himself to the utmost for you; why do
you go on speaking of fault or no fault?" Chi was suddenly
greatly enlightened: he said, "There's not much to Huang Po's
Buddha Dharma." Ta Yu grabbed and held him and said, "You
just said you were at fault; now instead you say there's not
much to the Buddha Dharma." Chi hit Ta Yu in the side three
times with his fist; Yu pushed him away and said, "Your
teacher is Huang Po; it has nothing to do with me."
One day Huang Po, instructing his community, said, "The
Great Master Fa Jung of Ox Head Mountainc spoke horizon­
tally and spoke vertically, but he still didn't know the key of
transcendence. These days the Ch'an followers after Shih T'ou
and Ma Tsu speak of Ch'an and speak of the Way most vo­
luminously." But why did Huang Po talk this way? It was
because of this that he taught the community by saying, "All
of you are gobblers of dregs; if you travel around like this,
you'll get laughed at by people. As soon as you hear of a place
with eight hundred or a thousand people, you immediately go
there. It won't do just to seek out the hubbub; if you always
take things this easy here, then where else would there be this
matter of Today?"
In T'ang times they liked to revile people by calling them
"gobblers of dregs," so many people say that Huang Po was
reviling the people. Those with eyes see for themselves what
he was getting at. The whole idea is to let down a hook to fish
out people's questions. In the assembly there was a Ch'an man
who didn't fear for his body or life, so he could come forth this
way from the crowd to question Huang Po, saying, "Then what
about those in various places who order followers and lead
communities?" And he makes a good point, too. After all the
old fellow Huang Po couldn't explain, so instead he broke
down and said, "I don't say there is no Ch'an, just that there are
no teachers." But tell me, where does his meaning lie?
That essence of the school that has come down from ancient
times-sometimes holding, sometimes letting go, sometimes
killing, sometimes giving life, sometimes releasing, sometimes
gathering up-I dare to ask all of you, what would be a teacher
of Ch'an? As soon as I speak this way, I've already lost my
head. People, where are your nostrils? (A pause) They've been
pierced through!

VERSE

His cold severe solitary mien does not take pride in itself;

Solemnly dwelling in the sea of the world, he distinguishes

itiate, and it is also necessary that black and white be
clearly distinguished.*

rivers and the great earth, all are at Huang Po's place
begging for their lives.*

COMMENTARY

This verse by Hsueh Tou seems just like praise on a portrait of
Huang Po, yet you people mustn't understand it as "praise on a
portrait." Right in his words there's a place to get oneself out.ct
Hsueh Tou clearly says, "His cold severe solitary mien does
not take pride in itself." When Huang Po instructed the com­
munity this way, he wasn't contesting others or asserting
himself, displaying himself or boasting of himself. If you un­
derstand what happened here, you are free in all directions:
sometimes you stand alone on a solitary peak, sometimes you
stretch out in the bustling market place. How could you one­
sidedly hold fast to a single corner? The more you abandon, the
more you aren't at rest; the more you seek, the more you don't
see; the more you take on, the more you sink down. An An­
cient said, "Without wings, fly through the sky; with fame,
become known throughout the world." Wholeheartedly dis-

card the marvelous wonders of the principle of Buddha
Dharma; let it all go at once, and then you will after all have
gotten somewhere, and wherever you are it will naturally be­
come manifest.
HsuehTau says, "Solemnly dwelling in the sea of the world,
he distinguishes dragons and snakes." Is it a dragon or is it a
snake? As soon as anyone comes in through the door, he puts
him to the test; this is called the eye to distinguish dragons and
snakes, the ability to capture tigers and rhinos. Hsueh Tau also
said, "Judging dragons and snakes-how is that eye correct?
Capturing tigers and rhinos-that skill is not complete."
HsuehTau also says, "Ta Chung the Son of Heaven has been
lightly handled; three times he personally felt those claws and
fangs at work." Huang Po is not just acting bad right here (in
this case); he's always been like this. As forTa Chung the Son
of Heaven (Emperor), it is recorded in the Continued Biog­
raphies of the Hsien T'ung Era that theT'ang Emperor Hsien
Tsung (r. 806-820) had two sons, one called MuTsung and the
other called HsuanTsung. This HsuanTsung (r. 847-860) was
theTa Chung Emperor.
When Hsuan Tsung was thirteen years old, though still
young, he was keen and clever, and always liked to sit in the
lotus posture. During the reign of Mu Tsung (821-824), one
time when the morning audience was over, Hsuan Tsung play­
fully mounted the (Imperial) DragonThrone and went through
the motions of saluting the assembled officials. One of the
great ministers saw this and thought that Hsuan Tsung was
demented, so he reported this to MuTsung. When MuTsung
saw HsuanTsung, he rubbed his head and sighed, saying, "My
younger brother is indeed a valiant son of my clan."
Mu Tsung died in

824, leaving three sons, called Ching

Tsung, WenTsung, and WuTsung. ChingTsung succeeded to
his father's throne and reigned for two years until the inner
court plotted against him and removed him. Wen Tsung suc­
ceeded to the throne and reigned for fourteen years. When Wu
Tsung came to the throne, he always spoke of HsuanTsung as
an imbecile. One day, filled with hatred for Hsuan Tsung be­
cause long ago he had playfully climbed up on his father's
throne, he finally had Hsuan Tsung beaten almost to death,
thrown out into the back gardens, and drenched with filthy
water to revive him.

Eleventh Case

79

After this Hsuan Tsung went into hiding in the community
of the Master Chih Hsien of Hsiang Yen. Later he had his head
shaved as a novice, but had not yet received full ordination. He
travelled around with Chih Hsien; when they got to Mount Lu,
Chih Hsien made up a poem about a waterfall:
Piercing the clouds, penetrating rock, never declin­
ing the work;
When the land is distant, you know how high is the
place it appears.

Having intoned these two lines, Chih Hsien remained a long
time in thought; he wanted to draw out a stream of words from
Hsuan Tsung to see what he was like. Hsuan Tsung continued
the verse, saying,
How can the mountain torrent be held back�
Eventually it must return to the great ocean to be­
come waves.

At this Chih Hsien knew that Hsuan Tsung was no ordinary
man, and he silently acknowledged him.
Later Hsuan Tsung went into the community at Yen Kuan,
where he was asked to be the temple scribe. Huang Po was
there serving as head monk. One day as Huang Po was paying
respects to (an image of a) Buddha, Hsuan Tsung saw him and
asked, "If you don't seek from Buddha, don't seek from
Dharma, and don't seek from the Sangha, then what are you
seeking by bowing in respect?" Huang Po replied, "I don't seek
from Buddha, I don't seek from the Dharma, and I don't seek
from the Sangha; I always pay my respects this way." Hsuan
Tsung said, "What's the use of paying respect?" Immediately
Huang Po slapped him. Hsuan Tsung said, "Too coarse."
Huang Po said, "What place is this to talk of coarse and fine?"
and slapped him again. Later, when Hsuan Tsung succeeded to
the throne of the nation, he bestowed on Huang Po the title,
"Coarse-acting Ascetic." When prime minister P'ei was at
court later, he proposed that Huang Po be given the title Tuan
Chi Ch'an Shih, "Boundless Ch'an Master."
Hsueh Tou knew where his bloodline appeared, so he could
use it cleverly. Right now is there anyone to use his claws and
fangs? If so, then I'll strike!

According to Tenkei Denson, the following verse is probably not
really Huang Po's; it does not appear in the version of this story
given in the Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu. Tenkei also says that the

use in this commentary, and is probably a later insertion.

Fourth Patriarch of Ch'an after Bodhidharma. A distinguished
meditation master, Fa Jung is known as the first patriarch of the
so-called Ox Head sect of Ch'an, which continued for ten genera­
tions and produced numerous distinguished masters. Although
historically of independent origin, this sect later developed close
relations with the streams of the Ts'ao Ch'i succession.

This means a place which reveals Huang Po's state, and the way a
student must go to realize his sphere of attainment. To 'get one­
self out' has the meaning of 'appearing in the world' (though this
latter expression usually has the specific meaning of accepting
leadership of a community as the spiritual guide, it can have the
more inclusive meaning of actively revealing enlightened knowl­
edge and conduct). The Zen master Dogen, in his Fukanzazengi,
says, 'Although one may roam freely in the realm of entry, one
may lack a living road to get himself out on.'

TWELFTH CASE

Tung Shan's Three Pounds of Hemp

POINTER

The sword that kills people, the sword that brings people to
life: this is the standard way of high antiquity and the essential
pivot for today as well. If you discuss killing, you don't harm a
single hair; if you discuss giving life, you lose your body and
life. Therefore it is said, "The thousand sages have not trans­
mitted the single transcendental path; students toil over ap­
pearances like monkeys grasping at reflections." Tell me, since
it is not transmitted, why then so many complicated public
cases? Let those with eyes try to explain.

CASE

A monk asked Tung Shan, "What is Buddha?"1

Tung Shan said, "Three pounds of hemp."2

COMMENTARY

So many people misunderstand this public case. It really is
hard to chew on, since there's no place for you to sink your
teeth into. What is the reason? Because it's bland and flavor­
less. The Ancients had quite a few answers to the question
"What is Buddha?" One said, "The one in the shrine." One
said, "The thirty-two auspicious marks." One said, "A bamboo
whip on a mountain covered with a forest grown from a staff."
81

82

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

And so on, to Tung Shan, who said, "Three pounds of hemp."
He couldn't be stopped from cutting off the tongues of the
Ancients.
Many people base their understanding on the words and say
that Tung Shan was in the storehouse at the time weighing out
hemp when the monk questioned him, and therefore he an­
swered in this way. Some say that when Tung Shan is asked
about the east he answers about the west. Some say that since
you are Buddha and yet you still go to ask about Buddha, Tung
Shan answers this in a roundabout way. And there's yet an­
other type of dead men who say that the three pounds of hemp
is itself Buddha. But these interpretations are irrelevant. If you
seek from Tung Shan's words this way, you can search until
Maitreya Buddha is born down here and still never see it even
in a dream.
What's the reason? Words and speech are just vessels to
convey the Path. Far from realizing the intent of the Ancients,
people just search in their words; what grasp can they get on it?
Haven't you seen how an Ancient said, "Originally the Path is
wordless; with words we illustrate the Path. Once you see the
Path, the words are immediately forgotten." To get to this
point, you must first go back to your own original state. Just
this three pounds of hemp is like the single track of the great
road to the Capital; as you raise your feet and put them down,
there's nothing that is not this. This story is the same as Yun
Men's saying "Cake"a but it's unavoidably difficult to under­
stand. My late teacher Wu Tsu made a verse about it:
The cheap-selling board-carrying fellow
Weighs it out, three pounds of hemp.
With a hundred thousand years of unsold goods,
He has no place to put it all.
You must clean it all up; when your defiling feelings, concep­
tual thinking, and comparative judgements of gain and loss and
right and wrong are all cleared away at once, then you will
spontaneously understand.

VERSE

The Golden Ravenb hurries;
**In the left eye, half a pound.

Twelfth Case

The swift sparrowhawk can't overtake it.
Lay the body down in flames of fire.*
The fade Rabbitc is swift.
**In the right eye, eight ounces.
He makes his nest in the palace of Heng 0, the Moon
Lady.*
Has there ever been carelessness in a good response?
**As the bell when struck, as the valley embracing the
echo.*
To see Tung Shan as laying out facts in accordance with the
situation
**Mistakenly sticking by the zero point of the scale; it's
just Your Reverence who sees things this way.*
Is like a lame tortoise and a blind turtle entering an empty
valley.
**Take what's coming to you and get out. In the same
pit, there's no different dirt. Who killed your sparrow­
hawk?*
Flowering groves, multicolored forests;
**A double case; he handles all crimes with the same
indictment. As before, they're the same.*
Bamboo of the South, wood of the North.
**A quadruple case. He puts a head on top of his head.*
So I think of Ch'ang Ch'ing and Officer Lu:
**A leper drags his companions along with him.
I am this way, and Hsueh Tou is this way too.*
He knew how to say he should laugh, not cry.
**Ha ha. By day and by night he adds to the suffering.*
Hat
**Bah! What is this? I strike!*

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou can see all the way through, so he immediately
says, "The Golden Raven hurries; the Jade Rabbit is swift."
This is of the same kind as Tung Shan's reply "Three pounds of
hemp." The sun rises, the moon sets; every day it's like this.
People often make up intellectual interpretations and just say,

84

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"The Golden Raven is the left eye and the Jade Rabbit is the
right eye." As soon as they're questioned, they put a glare in
their eyes and say, "They're here!" What connection is there? If
you understand in this way, the whole school of Bodhidharma
would be wiped off the face of the earth. That is why it is said,

Letting down the hook in the four seas
Just to fish out terrible dragons;
The mysterious device outside conventions
Is for seeking out those who know the self.
Hsueh Tou is a man who has left the heaps and elements;ct
how could he make up this sort of interpretation? Hsueh Tou
easily goes to where the barriers are broken and the hinges are
smashed to reveal a little something to let you see; there he
adds a footnote, saying, "Has there ever been carelessness in a
good response?" Tung Shan does not reply lightly to this
monk; he is like a bell when struck, like a valley embracing an
echo. Great or small, he responds accordingly, never daring to
make a careless impression. At once Hsueh Tou has brought
out his guts and presented them to all of you. Hsueh Tou had a
verse on being tranquil but responding well:

Presented face to face, it's not a matter of multiplic­
ity;
Dragons and snakes are easily distinguished, but a
patchrobed monk is hard to deceive.
The golden hammer's shadow moves, the jewel
sword's light is cold;
They strike directly; hurry up and take a look!
When Tung Shan first saw Yun Men, Yun Men asked him,
"Where have you just come from?" Tung Shan said, "From Cha
Tu." Yun Men said, "Where did you spend the summer re­
treat?" Tung Shan said, "In Hunan, at Pao Tz'u." Yun Men
asked, "When did you leave there?" Tung Shan said, "August
twenty-fifth." Yun Men said, "I should let you have three score
blows of the staff; go meditate in the hall."
That evening Tung Shan entered Yun Men's room; drawing
near, he asked, "Where was my fault?" Yun Men said, "You
rice bag! From Kiangsi to Hunan, and still you go on this way."
At these words Tung Shan was vastly and greatly awakened.
After a while he said, "Another day I'll go to a place where

Twelfth Case

85

there are no human hearths and build myself a hut; I won't
store even a single grain of rice or plant any vegetables. There
I'll receive and wait upon the great sages coming and going
from the ten directions; I'll pull out all the nails and pegs for
them, I'll pull off their greasy caps and strip them of their
stinking shirts. I'll make them all clean and free, so they can be
unconcerned people." Yun Men said, "Your body is the size of
a coconut, but you can open such a big mouth."
Tung Shan then took his leave and departed. His enlighten­
ment at the time was a direct complete breakthrough; how
could it have anything in common with small petty views?
Later when he appeared in the world to respond to people's
various potentialities, the words "Three pounds of hemp" were
understood everywhere merely as a reply to the question about
Buddha; they just make their reasoning in terms of Buddha.
Hsueh Tou says that to understand Tung Shan's reply as ex­
pressing facts in accordance with the situation is like a lame
tortoise or a blind turtle going into an empty valley; when will
they ever find a way out?
"Flowering groves, multicolored forests." When a monk
asked Master Hsien of Fu Teh," "What is the mind of the Bud­
dhas of antiquity?" The master replied, "Flowering groves,
multicolored forests." The monk also asked Ming Chiao,
"What is the inner meaning of 'three pounds of hemp'?" Ming
Chiao said, "Bamboo of the South, wood of the North." The
monk came back and recounted this to Tung Shan, who said, "I
won't explain this just for you, but I will explain it to the whole
community." Later he went into the hall and said, "Words do
not express facts, speech does not accord with the situation.
Those who accept words are lost, and those who linger over
phrases are deluded."
To smash people's intellectual views, Hsueh Tou purposely
draws these together on a single thread to produce his verse.
Yet people of later times still give rise to even more intellec­
tual views and say, " 'Three pounds of hemp' is the robe of
mourning; bamboo is the staff of mourning: that's why he said,
'Bamboo of the South, wood of the North.' 'Flowering groves,
multicolored forests' is the flowers and plants painted on the
coffin." Do these people realize their disgrace? How far are
they from realizing that "bamboo of the South, wood of the
North" and "three pounds of hemp" are just like "daddy" and

86

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"poppa." When the Ancients answered with a turn of words,
their intention was definitely not like these (interpretations).
It's just like Hsueh Tau's saying, "The Golden Raven hurries;
the Jade Rabbit is swift"-it's just as broad. It's just that real
gold and fool's gold are hard to tell apart; similar written
characters are not the same.
Hsueh Tou has the kind heart of an old woman; he wants to
break up your feelings of doubt, so he brings in more dead men.
"So I think of Ch'ang Ch'ing and Officer Lu; he knew how to
say he should laugh, not cry." To discuss the verse itself, the
first three lines by themselves have already completed the
verse. But I ask you, since the whole universe is just this three
pounds of hemp, why does Hsueh Tou still have so many com­
plications? It's just that his compassion is excessive, therefore
he is like this.
When Officer Lu Hsuan was Inspector of Hsuan Chou, he
studied with Nan Ch'uan. When Nan Ch'uan passed on, Lu
heard the (sound of) mourning so he entered the temple for the
funeral. He laughed aloud a great laugh. The temple director
said to him, "The late master and you were teacher and disci­
ple; why aren't you crying?" Officer Lu said, "If you can say
something, I'll cry." The temple director was speechless. Lu
gave a loud lament; "Alas! Alas! Our late master is long gone."
Later Ch'ang Ch'ing heard of this and said, "The officer should
have laughed, not cried."
Hsueh Tou borrows the essence of this meaning to say that
if you make up these kinds of intellectual interpretations, this
calls for laughter, not crying. This is so, but at the very end
there's a single word which is unavoidably easy to misun­
derstand, when he goes on to say "Ha!" Has Hsueh Tou washed
himself clean?

The heaps (Sanskrit

mind), the six sense fields (form, sound, smell, taste, feeling, and
entity), and the six associated consciousnesses. While the five
heaps are often used to refer specifically to the human being, in
which context the synergies include all sorts of mental activities
such as emotion and volition, functional relations not connected
with mind are also classified as synergies. It is obvious in this
context that to leave the five heaps and eighteen elements does
not mean annihilation, but refers to being free from attachment
to them, having died the esoteric death, sloughed off the claims of
egoism, under whose sway emotion and intellect, thought and
habit, had been in fact inseparable.

Pa Ling's Snow in a Silver Bowl

POINTER

Clouds are frozen over the great plains, but the whole world is
not hidden. When snow covers the white flowers, it's hard to
distinguish the outlines. Its coldness is as cold as snow and ice;
it fineness is as fine as rice powder. Its depths are hard for even
a Buddha's eye to peer into; its secrets are impossible for de­
mons and outsiders to fathom. Leaving aside "understanding
three when one is raised" for the moment, still he cuts off the
tongues of everyone on earth. Tell me, whose business is this?
To test, I cite this: look!

COMMENTARY

People often misunderstand and say this is a heretical school.
What does this have to do with it? The fifteenth Patriarch, the
honorable Kanadeva, was indeed (at one time) numbered
among the outsiders; but when he met the fourteenth Pa­
triarch, the honorable Nagarjuna (who presented a bowl of
water to him), he put a needle into the bowl: Nagarjuna es­
teemed his capacity, transmitted the Buddha Mind School to
him, and invested him as the fifteenth Patriarch.
88

Thirteenth Case

89

In doctrinal disputes in India the winner holds a red flag in
his hand, while the loser turns his clothes inside out and de­
parts through a side door. Those who wanted to hold doctrinal
disputes in India were required to obtain royal permission.
Bells and drums would be sounded in the great temples and
afterwards the debates could begin. In Kanadeva's day the here­
tics impounded the bell and drum in the (Buddhist) community
temple in a purge. At this time the honorable Kanadeva knew
that the Buddhist Teaching was in trouble, so he made use of
his supernatural powers to ascend the bell tower and ring the
bell, for he wanted to drive out the heretics.
Soon one of the heretics called out, "Who is up in the tower
ringing the bell?" Kanadeva said, "A deva." The heretic asked,
"Who is the deva?" Kanadeva said, "1." The heretic said "Who
is 'I'?'' Kanadeva said, " 'You' is a dog." The heretic asked,
"Who is the dog?" Kanadeva said, "The dog is you." After
seven go-rounds like this, the heretic realized he was beaten, so
he submitted and himself opened the door of the bell tower,
whereupon Kanadeva came down from the tower holding a red
flag. The heretic said, "Why do you not follow?" Kanadeva
said, "Why do you not precede?" The heretic said, "You're a
knave." Kanadeva said, "You're a freeman."
Over and over Kanadeva would respond to questions like
this, using his unobstructed powers of argument to overcome
heretics, who would therefore submit. At such times the hon­
orable Kanadeva would hold a red flag in his hand, and the one
who had been defeated would stand beneath the flag. Among
the heretics, to have their hands cut was generally the punish­
ment to expiate the fault (or defeat in argument), but at this
time Kanadeva put a stop to this; he only required his defeated
adversaries to shave off their hair and enter the Buddhist path.
Therefore the school of Kanadeva flourished greatly. Later on
Hsueh Tou uses these facts to versify this.
Ma Tsu said, "The Lankavatara scripture says that Buddha's
words have mind as their source and the gate of nothingness as
the gate of the Dharma." Ma Tsu also said, "Whenever there
are words and phrases, this is the Kanadeva school; just this he
considered to be principal."
All of you are guests in the school of the patchrobed monks;
have you ever thoroughly comprehended the school of
Kanadeva as well? If you have thoroughly comprehended it,
then the ninety-six kinds of heretics are all vanquished by you

90

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

all at once. If you have not been able to comprehend it
thoroughly, then you can't avoid going off with your clothes on
inside out. Tell me, what about this? If you say words are it,
this has no connection; if you say words are not it, this has no
connection either. Tell me, where does Great Master Ma's
meaning lie?
Later Yun Men said, "Great Master Ma spoke good words,
but no one asks about it." Thereupon a monk asked, "What is
the school of Kanadeva?" Yun Men said, "Of the ninety-six
kinds of heretics, you are the lowest."
Formerly there was a monk who was taking leave ofTa Sui.
Ta Sui asked, "Where are you going?" The monk said, "To do
homage to Samantabhadra." Ta Sui raised his whisk and said,
"Manjusri and Samantabhadra are both here." The monk drew
a circle and pushed it towards Ta Sui with his hand; then he
threw it behind him. Ta Sui said, "Attendant, bring a spot of
tea for this monk."
Yun Men also said, "In India they cut off heads and arms;
here you take what's coming to you and get out." He also said,
"The red flag is in my hand."
In the community (of Yun Men) PaLing was called Mouthy
Chien.When he was travelling around he always sewed sitting
mats." He had attained deeply into the great matter upon
which Yun Men tread: thus he was outstanding. Later he ap­
peared in the world as a Dharma successor to Yun Men. For­
merly he dwelt at Pa Ling in Yueh Chou (in Hunan). He didn't
compose any document of succession to the teaching, but just
took three turning words to offer up to YunMen: "What is the
Path? A clear eyed man falls into a well." "What is the sword
(so sharp it cuts) a hair blown (against it)? Each branch of coral
upholds the moon." "What is the school of Kanadeva? Piling
up snow in a silver bowl." Yun Men said, "Later on, on the
anniversary of my death, just recite these three turning words,
and you will have repaid my kindness in full." Thereafter, as it
turned out, he did not hold ceremonial feasts on the anniver­
saries of his death, but followed Yun Men's will and just
brought up these turning words.
Although people from all over have given answers to this
question ("What is the school of Kanadeva?"), mostly they
have turned to events to make up their answers; there is only
Pa Ling who speaks as he does-he's extremely lofty and

Thirteenth Case

91

unique, unavoidably difficult to understand. Then too, without
revealing a trace of his sharp point, he takes on enemies on all
sides, and blow by blow finds a way to get himself out. He has
the skill to fell tigers; he strips off human emotional views. As
for the matter of One Form/ to get here you must have pene­
trated all the way through on your own, but after all you must
meet another (enlightened) person before you are done. There­
fore it is said, "When Tao Wu brandished his sceptre, one who
was his equal would understand;ct when Shih Kung bent his
bow, an adept would tacitly comprehend."e For this truth, if
you have no master to seal and instruct you, what teaching can
you use to carry on the esoteric conversation?
Afterwards Hsueh Tau picked things out and brought them
up for people in this verse:

VERSE

Old Hsin K'ai
**A thousand soldiers are easy to get, but one general is
hard to find. Talkative teacher!*
Is truly something else:
**What truth is this? Have you ever felt his single knock
on your head, even in a dream?*
He knows how to say, "Piling up snow in a silver bowl."
**The frog can't leap out of the basket. A double case.
Quite a few people will lose their bodies and lives.*
The ninety-six each must know for themselves;
**You're included too; but do you know, Reverend?
All are buried in the same pit.*
If you don't know, then ask the moon in the sky.
**It's farther than far. Take what's coming to you and
get out. Address your plea to the sky.*
The school of Kanadeva, Kanadeva's school;
**What are you saying? I'm here. A mouthful of frost. *
Beneath the red flag, arouse the pure wind.
**Shattered in a hundred fragments. Having struck, I'll
say I've already hit it. fust cut off your heads and
arms, and I'll speak a phrase for you.*

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

"Old Hsin K'ai." Hsin K'ai is the name of a monastery (in Pa
Ling, Hunan, where the master Pa Ling stayed, hence a name
for him). "Is truly something else." Hsueh Tou has ample
praise for him. But tell me, how is Pa Ling special? "All words
are the Buddha Dharma." When I talk like this, what's the
reason for it? Hsueh Tou subtly reveals a little of his meaning
when he says it's just that Pa Ling is truly something else.f
Afterwards he opens up and says, "He can say, 'Piling up snow
in a silver bowl.' "
Hsueh Tou goes on to provide you with further footnotes:
"The ninety-six must each know for themselves." Before they
can do so, they must acknowledge defeat. If you don't know,
ask the moon in the sky. The Ancient used to give this answer,
"Ask the moon in the sky."
Hsueh Tau's eulogy being finished, at the end there must be
a living road, a phrase where the lion rears. He raises it higher
for you and says, "The school of Kanadeva, the Kanadeva
school; beneath the red flag, arouse the pure wind." Pa Ling
said he piled up snow in a silver bowl; why then does Hsueh
Tou say he roused the pure wind beneath the red flag? Do you
know that Hsueh Tou kills people without using a sword?

'
TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

This obscure phrase is interpreted by commentators (hence trans­
lated) in various ways. It means the question is cracked and shat­
tered, the answer is piercing and penetrating. Hence it can mean
profusion, confusion, or it can mean opened up, clearly distinct
(this latter includes the manifold, that everything is revealed in
all its multiplicity). One commentator says that in this case it
refers to the profuse discourse of the Kanadeva school, rep­
resented by Pa Ling's answer. Tenkei says that it means here
burst open, clear and distinct, not hard to see.

b.

This is interpreted in two ways; one, that Pa Ling travelled
around with his sitting mat folded up, meaning that he did not
prostrate himself before the teachers he visited (one rolls out
one's mat to bow in full prostration). It is also interpreted to mean
that he used to sew others' sitting mats for them.

Or, 'One Color'; unity, or equanimity. In Tung Shan Liang
Chieh's Pao Ching San Mei Ke, 'Song of the Jewel Mirror Concen­
tration' (9th century), it says 'Piling up snow in a silver bowl,
hiding a heron in the bright moonlight; when you array them they
are not the same, when you mix them you know where they are.'
Silver and snow, moonlight and the white heron, are all white,
but when associated, they are not identically the same; this sym­
bolizes the sameness within difference, the difference within
sameness. Sameness and difference correspond to the 'heart of
nirvana' (equanimity) and the 'knowledge of differentiation/
sometimes referred to as successive stages on the Ch'an path. It is
this latter that is in the sphere of 'meeting another.'

d.

Kuan Nan Tao Wu, while on his foot travels, once heard a
shamaness in a village spirit shrine take up her sceptre and intone
her pledge to the spirit; at one point she said, 'Do you know the
spirit or not?' whereupon Tao Wu was greatly enlightened. After
travelling around to various places, he came to Kuan Nan Tao
Ch'ang; to show his realization, Tao Wu flourished a sceptre,
whereupon Tao Ch'ang recognized his enlightenment.

Shih Kung, a successor of Ma Tsu, was formerly a hunter. Later,
he used to draw his bow on those who came to ask about Ch'an.
When San P'ing came to him, he drew his bow; San P'ing bared
his breast and said, 'Is this a killing arrow or a life-giving arrow?'
Shih Kung threw away his bow and said that after thirty years he
had finally managed to shoot half a sage.

This phrase also conveys the sense, 'his real point is distinct.'

COMMENTARY

Members of the Ch'an family, if you want to know the mean­
ing of Buddha-nature, you must observe times and seasons,
causes and conditions. This is called the special transmission
outside the (written) teachings, the sole transmission of the
mind seal, directly pointing to the human mind for the percep­
tion of nature and realization of Buddhahood.
For forty-nine years old Shakyamuni stayed in the world; at
three hundred and sixty assemblies he expounded the sudden
and the gradual, the temporary and the true. These are what is
called the teachings of a whole lifetime.a The monk (in this
case) picked this out to ask, "What are the teachings of a whole
lifetime?" Why didn't Yun Men explain for him in full detail,
but instead said to him, "An appropriate statement"?
As usual, within one sentence of Yun Men three sentences
are bound to be present. These are called the sentence that
encloses heaven and earth, the sentence that follows the
waves, and the sentence that cuts off the myriad streams. He
lets go and gathers up; he's naturally extraordinary, like cut-

94

Fourteenth Case

95

ting nails or shearing through iron. He makes people unable to
comprehend him or figure him out. The whole great treasure­
house of the teachings just comes down to three words ("An
appropriate statement"); there is no facet or aspect in which
you can rationalize this.
People often misunderstand and say, "Buddha's preaching
was appropriate to the conditions of one time." Or they say,
"The multitude of appearances and myriad forms are all the
impressions of a single truth,"b and call this "an appropriate
statement." Then there are those who say, "It's just talking
about that one truth." What connection is there? Not only do
they not understand, they also enter hell as fast as

an

arrow

flies. They are far from knowing that the meaning of that man
of old is not like this.
Therefore it is said, "Shattering one's bones and crushing
one's body is still not sufficient recompense; when a single
phrase is understood, you transcend ten billion." Undeniably
extraordinary: "What are the teachings of a whole lifetime?"
just boils down to his saying, "An appropriate statement." If
you can grasp this immediately, then you can return home and
sit in peace. If you can't get it, then listen humbly to the ver­
dict:

VERSE

An appropriate statement;
**Leaping with life.
The words are still in our ears.
Undeniably unique and lofty. *
How utterly unique!
**The onlooker has some part in it.

COMMENTARY

"An appropriate statement; how utterly unique!" Hsueh Tou
cannot praise him enough. These words of Yun Men are inde­
pendent and free, unique and lofty, prior to light and after an­
nihilation. They are like an overhanging cliff ten thousand
fathoms high. Then, too, they are like a million man battle
line; there is no place for you to get in. It's just that it's too
solitary and perilous.
An Ancient said, "If you want to attain intimacy, don't use a
question to ask a question; the question is in the answer and
the answer is in the point of the question." Of course it's solit­
ary and steep, but tell me, where is it that it's solitary and
steep? No one on earth can do anything about it.
This monk (in the case) was also an adept, and that is why he
could question like this. And Yun Men too answered this way,
much like "wedging a stake into the iron hammerhead with no
hole." Hsueh Tou employs literary language so artfully!
"Under the Jambu Tree I'm laughing; ha, ha!" In the Scripture
on the Creation of the World it says, "On the south side of
Sumeru a crystal tree shines over the continent of Jambu, mak­

ing all in between a clear blue color. This continent takes its
name from this great tree; hence it is called Jambudvipa. This
tree is seven thousand leagues high; beneath it are the golden

Fourteenth Case

97

mounds of the Jambu altar, which is twenty leagues high. Since
gold is produced from beneath the tree, it is called the Jambu
tree."
Thus Hsueh Tou says of himself that he is under the Jambu
tree laughing out loud. But tell me, what is he laughing at? He's
laughing at the black dragon who last night got his horn
wrenched off. He's just looking up respectfully; he can only
praise Yun Men. When Yun Men says, "An appropriate state­
ment," what's it like? It's like breaking off one of the black
dragon's horns. At this point, if there were no such thing, how
could he have spoken as he did?
Hsueh Tou has finished his verse all at once, but he still has
something to say at the very end: "Exceptional, exceptional­
the old man of Shao Yang got one horn." Why doesn't Hsueh
Tou say he got them both? How is it that he just got one horn?
Tell me, where is the other horn?

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

According to the analysis of Chih I, founder of the T'ien T'ai
school of Chinese Buddhism, Buddha's teaching was divided into
five periods: first, the period of the Hua Yen (Avatamsaka) scrip­
ture, where the Buddha directly expressed his own realization
under the tree of enlightenment. Second, since no one at the time
could understand the first, he expounded the Agamas for twelve
years to suit elementary capacities. Third, he preached a tran­
sitional stage from this lesser to the greater vehicle, known as the
extensive, or universally equal scriptures. Fourth, he preached the
transcendence of wisdom. Fifth, he preached the Lotus of Truth
(Saddharmapundarika)

and

Great

Decease

(Mahaparinirvana)

scriptures. The teaching is divided by the Hua Yen school into the
lesser vehicle, the elementary greater vehicle, the final greater
vehicle, the sudden teaching, and the round, or complete teach­
ing.
b.

This saying comes from the Dhammapada; Yun Men's reply can
be read as 'teaching in reference to one.'

c.

The old man of Shao Yang is Yun Men. The horn is the stake
driven into the holeless hammerhead. A hammerhead without a
hole is an image used for something into which the 'handle' of
logic and reason cannot be fit.

FIFTEENTH CASE

Yun Men's Upside-Down Statement

POINTER

The single-edged sword that kills people, the double-edged
sword that brings people to life; the customary rule of high
antiquity is still the pivotal essential for today. But tell me,
right now, which is the sword that kills people, which is the
sword that brings people to life? To test, I cite this; look!

CASE

A monk asked Yun Men, "When it's not the present intellect
and it's not the present phenomena, what is it?"1·a
Yun Men said, "An upside-down statement."2

NOTES

1.

Why the leaping about? Fall back three thousand miles.

2.

They come out even. Truth comes out of the convict's mouth; he
can't be let go. He stretches out his body in the wild weeds.

COMMENTARY

This monk is unquestionably an adept, to know how to pose
questions like this. The question by the monk in the previous
case is called "asking for more instruction"; in the present case
it is a question to demonstrate understanding, and it can also
be called a question with a concealed barb. For anyone but Yun
Men, there would have been no way to cope with this monk.
Yun Men possesses such ability that he cannot but reply once
the question is raised. Why? An expert teaching master is like a
bright mirror on its stand; if a foreigner comes a foreigner is

reflected, and if a native comes a native is reflected.

98

Fifteenth Case

99

An Ancient said, "If you want to attain intimate under­
standing, don't use a question to ask a question. Why? Because
the answer is where the question is." Since when have the
sages from past times ever had anything to give to people?
Where is there Ch'an or Tao that can be given to you? If you

don't do hellish deeds, naturally you will not bring on hellish
results. If you don't create heavenly conditions, naturally you
won't receive heavenly rewards. All circumstances of activity
are self-made and self-received. The Ancient Yun Men clearly
tells you, "When we discuss this affair, it's not in the words
and phrases. If it were in words and phrases, doesn't the twelve
part canon of the three vehicles have words and phrases? Then
what further use would there be for the Patriarch's coming
from the West?"
In the previous case Yun Men said, "An appropriate state­
ment." Here, on the other hand, he says, "An upside-down
statement." Since there's only a difference of a single word,
why then are there a thousand differences, ten thousand dis­
tinctions? Tell me, where is the confusion? This is why it is
said, "The Teaching is carried out according to facts; the ban­
ner of the Teaching is set up according to the situation."
"When it's not the present intellect and it's not the present
phenomena, what is it?" is just worth a nod of agreement.
Since Yun Men is a fellow with eyes, he can't be fooled one
little bit. Since the point of the question was abstruse and
misleading, the answer too had to be this way. In fact Yun Men
is riding the thief's horse in pursuit of the thief.
Some people mistakenly say, "Basically these are words of a
host, but it was a guest who spoke them; therefore Yun Men
said, 'An upside-down statement.' " What relevance does this
have?
This monk asked well; "When it's not the present intellect
and it's not the present phenomena, what is it?" Why didn't
Yun Men answer him with some other words? Why instead did
he just say to him, "An upside-down statement"? Yun Men at
once demolished him utterly. Still, to say "an upside-down
statement" at this point is to gouge out a wound in healthy
flesh. Why? "The emergence of tracks of words is the source
from which divergent opinions are born." Suppose there never
were words and phrases; have this pillar and lamp right here
ever had any words or phrases? Do you understand? If you don't

100

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

understand at this point, you still need to turn over before you
will know where the ultimate point of this is.

VERSE

An upside-down statement:
**Can't let it go. Mixed up. He wraps up all five
thousand and forty-eight volumes of the canon.*
Dividing one token,
**Part on your side, part on my side.
Half south of the river, half north of the river.
Walking together holding hands.*
Dying with you, being born with you, to give you certainty.
**Washing a lump of dirt in the mud. For what reason!
He won't let you go.*
The eighty-four thousand disciples of Buddha were not
phoenix feathers;
**They looked like feathers. He diminishes these
people's grandeur too much. Lacquer buckets are as
plentiful as hemp and millet.*
Thirty-three men entered the tiger's den.
**Only I can know. A single general is hard to find.
A band of wild fox spirits.*
Distinctly outstanding**How is it exceptional! A little boasting. Skip and leap
as you will.*
The moon in the churning rushing water.
**Under the blue sky and bright sun, he mistakes the
reflection for the head. Why so busy!*

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou too is undeniably an adept. Right under the first
line he immediately says, "Dividing one token." Clearly he
lets go of the ultimate and joins hands with Yun Men to walk
along together with him. Hsueh Tou has always had the tech­
nique of letting go; he dares to enter the mud and water for
your sake, to die and be born together with you. This is the

Fifteenth Case

101

reason Hsueh Tou praises Yun Men this way. In reality he has
no other purpose than to melt the glue and untie the bonds for
you, to pull out the nails and wrench out the pegs.
These days, however, people base themselves on his words
to spin out intellectual interpretations. Just as Yen T'ou said,
"Although Hsueh Feng was born of the same lineage as me, he
does not die of the same lineage as me." If Yun Men were not
someone whose whole capacity had penetrated through to lib­
eration, how could he die with you and be born with you? Why
can he do this? Because he is free from the many leaking points
of gain and loss, of is and is not.
Thus Tung Shan said, "If you would judge whether one
going beyond is genuine or false, there are three kinds of leak­
age: emotional leakage, leakage of views, and verbal leakage. If
there is leakage of views, the intellect does not stir from its
fixed position and falls into the poisonous sea. If feelings leak,
knowing always turns towards and against, and one's view is
biased. Verbal leakage embodies the marvel but loses the fun­
damental; the intellect confuses beginning and end. You
should know these three leaks for yourself."
There are also three mysteries; the mystery within the es­
sence, the mystery within the phrase, and the mystery within
the mystery." When the Ancients came into this realm, their
whole capacity was fully used: if you happened to be born, they
would be born together with you; if you happened to die, they
would die with you. They stretched out their bodies in the
tiger's mouth; letting go their hands and feet, they would fol­
low your lead for a thousand miles, for ten thousand miles.
Why? You must go back with them to get this one realization
before you'll understand.
As for "Eighty-four thousand disciples of Buddha were not
phoenix feathers," this is the assembly of eighty-four thousand
holy people on Vulture Peak of Spirit Mountain-they were
not phoenix feathers.'· The
Sung times

Southern History relates that in
(420-479) there lived Hsieh Ch'ao-tsung ("surpass­

ing his clan"), a man of Yang Hsia in Ch'en prefecture, the son
of Hsieh Feng ("phoenix"). He had studied widely and his liter­
ary talent was superlative. At court there was no one to equal
him; his contemporaries considered him unique. Since he was
skilled in the written word, he served as permanent attendant
at the capital. For the funeral ceremonies of the king's mother
Yinshu, Ch'ao-tsung composed a eulogy and presented it at

102

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

court. Emperor Wu saw what he had written and praised him
highly, saying, "Ch'ao-tsung does indeed have phoenix feath­
ers!" An old poem says,
Audiences over, the incense smoke fills his billow­
ing sleeves;
In the perfection of a poem, the perfect jewel lies in
the stroke of his brushtip.
If you want to know the excellence of the hereditary
managers of Imperial decrees,
On the pond right now there's a phoenix feather
floating.
In ancient times, at the assembly on Spirit Mountain, the
four groups (monks, nuns, men and women devotees) had
gathered like clouds. The World Honored One held up a flower;
Kashyapa alone changed his expression with a smile. The oth­
ers did not know his meaning. Taking this, Hsueh Tau says,
"The eighty-four thousand were not phoenix feathers; thirty­
three men entered the tiger's den."
Ananda asked Kashyapa, "The World Honored One be­
queathed to you his golden robe; what special teaching did he
transmit besides?" Kashyapa called out "Ananda!" Ananda re­
sponded. Then Kashyapa said, "Take down the banner pole in
front of the gate."ct Thereafter it was handed on from patriarch
to patriarch, in India and this country, through thirty-three
men. All had the ability to enter the tiger's den. The Ancients
said, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch a
tiger cub?" Yun Men is this kind of man, well able to accom­
pany people through birth and death. To help people, a teacher
of our school must get to be like this, to sit in the carved wood
seat of the teachers; abandoned, he makes you break open and
lets you grab the tiger's whiskers. He must have reached such a
realm to be able to teach. He has the seven thingse always with
him, so he can accompany (beings) through life and death. The
high he presses down, the low he uplifts; to those who lack he
gives. Those on the solitary peak he rescues and sends them
into the wild weeds; if they have fallen into the wild weeds, he
rescues them and puts them on the solitary peak. "If you enter
a molten cauldron or a fiery furnace, I too will enter the molten
cauldron and the fiery furnace." In reality there is no other
purpose, just to melt the sticking points and release the bonds
for you, to pull out nails and draw out pegs, to strip off the

Fifteenth Case

103

blinders, to unload the saddle bags. Master P'ing T'ien had a
most excellent verse:
Spiritual light undimmed,
Ages of good advice.
Once it comes through this door,
Don't keep any intellectual unde�tanding.

"Distinctly outstanding-the moon in the churning rushing
water." Hsueh Tou unfailingly has a way to show himself, and
also the skill to bring people to life. Hsueh Tou has picked this
out to get people to go themselves to awaken their living po­
tential. Don't follow another's words; if you follow them, that
indeed would be the moon in the churning rushing water.
Righ t now, how will you find peace and security? Let go!

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

The monk in this case is supposed to be the same as in the four­
teenth; the teachings of the age are devised and established ac­
cording to the state of the intellect and total capacity of the hear­
ers, in terms of the phenomenal situation. In an immediate sense,
the present intellect and phenomena mean perceiver and per­
ceived; according to Tenkei, the monk had seen that there is
nothing outside of mind, and that all things are empty.

b.

Also translated as three profundities, this was a classification of
the Lin Chi school, interpreted variously through the ages. The
mystery within the essence corresponds to the phrase that en­
closes heaven and earth; the mystery within the phrase corre­
sponds to the phrase that follows the waves; the mystery within
the mystery corresponds to the phrase that cuts off myriad
streams. Yun Men's replies are said to contain all three of these
aspects.

c.

Phoenix feather is a metaphor for someone of outstanding talent,
and also for a worthy successor.

The banner in front of a monastery in India signaled that teaching

SIXTEENTH CASE

Ching Ch'ing's Man in the Weeds

POINTER

The Path has no byroads; one who stands upon it is solitary and
dangerous.a The truth is not seeing or hearing; words and
thoughts are far removed from it. If you can penetrate through
the forest of thorns and untie the bonds of Buddhahood and
Patriarchy, you attain the land of inner peace, where all the
gods have no way to offer flowers, where outsiders have no gate
to spy through. Then you work all day without ever working,
talk all day without ever talking; then you can unfold the de­
vice of 'breaking in and breaking out' and use the double-edged
sword that kills and brings to life, with freedom and indepen­
dence.
Even if you are this way, you must also know that within
the gate of provisional expedients, there is 'one hand uplifting,
one hand pressing down'; yet this still only amounts to a little
bit: as for the fundamental matter, this has nothing to do with
it. What about the fundamental matter? To test, I cite this;
look!

CASE

A monk asked Ching Ch'ing, "I am breaking out; I ask the

Teacher to break in."1
Ching Ch'ing said, "Can you live or not?"2
The monk said, "If I weren't alive, I'd be laughed at by peo­
ple."3
Ching Ch'ing said, "You too are a man in the weeds."4

COMMENTARY

Ching Ch'ing was a successor of Hsueh Feng, and a contempo­
rary of the likes of Pen Jen, Hsuan Sha, Su Shan, and Fu of T'ai
Yuan. First he met Hsueh Feng and understood his message.
Thereafter he always used 'breaking in and breaking out' de­
vices to instruct later students. He was well able to expound
the teaching according to the potentialities of his listeners.
Once Ching Ch'ing taught the community saying, "In gen­
eral, foot-travelers must have the 'simultaneous breaking in
and breaking out' eye and must have the 'simultaneous break­
ing in and breaking out' function; only then can they be called
patchrobed monks. It's like when the mother hen wants to
break in, the chick must break out, and when the chick wants
to break out, the mother hen must break in."
Thereupon a monk came forward and asked, "When the
mother hen breaks in and the chick breaks out, from the
standpoint of the teacher, what does this amount to?" Ching
Ch'ing said, "Good news." The monk asked, "When the chick
breaks out and the mother hen breaks in, from the standpoint
of the student, what does this amount to?" Ching Ch'ing said,
"Revealing his face." From this we see that they did have the
device of 'simultaneous breaking in and breaking out' in Ching
Ch'ing's school.
This monk (in the case) was also a guest of his house, and
understood (Ching Ch'ing's) household affairs; therefore he
questioned like this: "I am breaking out; I ask the Teacher to
break in." Within the Ts'ao-Tung tradition this is called using
phenomena to illustrate one's condition. How so? When the
chick breaks out and the mother breaks in, naturally they are
perfectly simultaneous.
Ching Ch'ing too does well; we could say his fists and feet
are coordinated, his mind and eye illumine each other. He an-

106

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

swered immediately by saying, "Can you live or not?" The
monk too does well; he also knows how to change with the
circumstances. In this one sentence of Ching Ch'ing's there is
guest and there is host, there is illumination and there is func­
tion, there is killing and there is giving life.
The monk said, "If I weren't alive, I'd be laughed at by
people." Ching Ch'ing said, "You too are a man in the weeds."
He's first class at going into the mud and water, but nothing
stops his wicked hands and feet. Since the monk understood
enough to question in this way,

why did Ching Ch'ing

nevertheless say, "You too are a man in the weeds"? Because
the eye of an adept must be this way, like sparks struck from
stone, like flashing lightning. Whether you can reach it or not,
you won't avoid losing your body and life. If you are this way,
then you see Ching Ch'ing calling him a man in the weeds.
Therefore Nan Yuan taught his assembly saying, "In the
various places they only have the eye of simultaneous breaking
in and breaking out, but they don't have the function of simul­
taneous breaking in and breaking out." A monk came forward
and asked, "What is the function of simultaneous breaking in
and breaking out?" Nan Yuan said, "An adept does not break in
and break out; breaking in and breaking out are both at once
error." The monk said, "This is still doubtful to me." Nan
Yuan said, "What are you in doubt about?" The monk said,
"Error." Thereupon Nan Yuan struck him; the monk did not
agree, so Nan Yuan drove him out.
Later this monk went to Yun Men's community, where he
brought up the previous conversation. There was a monk who
said, "Did Nan Yuan's staff break?" The first monk was greatly
awakened. But tell me, where is the meaning? This monk re­
turned to see Nan Yuan, but since Nan Yuan had already
passed on, he saw Feng Hsueh instead. As soon as he bowed,
Feng Hsueh asked, "Aren't you the monk who was asking our
late teacher about the simultaneous breaking in and breaking
out?" The monk said,

"That's right." Feng Hsueh asked,

"What was your understanding at that time?" The monk said,
"At first it was as if I were walking in the light of a lamp." Feng
Hsueh said, "You've understood." But say, what principle is
this? This monk came and just said, "At first it was as if I were
walking in the light of a lamp." Why did Feng Hsueh im­
mediately tell him, "You've understood"?
Later Ts'ui Yen commented, "Although Nan Yuan puts his

Sixteenth Case

107

plans into operation from within his tent, nevertheless the
country is vast, the people are few, and sympathizers are rare."
Feng Hsueh commented, "At the time Nan Yuan should have
hit him right across the back the moment he opened his
mouth, to see what he would do." If you see this public case,
then you see where the monk and Ching Ch'ing met each
other. How will all of you avoid Ching Ch'ing calling you a
man in the weeds? For this reason Hsueh Tou likes his saying
"man in the weeds," so he presents it in verse:

VERSE

The Ancient Buddhas had a family style;
**The words are still in our ears. The model for all time.
Don't slander old Shakyamuni.

•

Responsive preaching comes to scornful detraction
**Why are your nostrils in my hand? Eight blows pays for
thirteen. What about you? He lets the initiative go, so I'll
strike.*
Chick and mother hen do not know each other;
**Since they don't know each other, why then
do they naturally break in and break out?

•

Who is it that breaks in and breaks out together?
**Shattered in a hundred fragments. (Hsueh Tou) has the
kindness of an old granny; but don't misunderstand.

•

A peck, and he awakens;
**What are you saying? You've fallen into the second­
ary.

•

But he's still in the shell.
**Why doesn't he stick his head out?

•

Once again he receives a blow;
• •

Wrong! I strike! A double case; triple, quadruple.*

All the patchrobed monks in the world name and describe it
in vain.
**He has let go; he needn't bring it up. Is there anyone
who can name or describe it? If there is, he too is a
man in the weeds. From remote antiquity, the dark­
ness is vast and boundless; it fills the channels and
clogs the gullies. No one understands.
•

108

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

With the one line "The Ancient buddhas had a family style,"
Hsm.:1 Tau has completed his verse. Whoever sticks his head
out simply won't be able to approach. If you do approach, you'll
fall off a cliff ten thousand miles hi gh. As soon as you come
out, you've fallen into the weeds. Even if you can go freely in
all directions, it wouldn't be worth a pinch.
Hsueh Tau says, "The Ancient buddhas had a family style."
It's not just right now that this is so; when old Shakyamuni
was first born, he pointed to the sky with one hand and to the
earth with the other hand, scanned the four directions and said,
"In the heavens and on earth, I alone am the Honored One."
Yun Men said, "If I had seen him then, I would have struck him
dead with one blow and fed him to the dogs, hoping that there
would be peace in the world." Only by being like this can one
reply appropriately. Thus, devices of breaking in and breaking
out are all in the family tradition of the Ancient Buddhas.
If you can attain to this Path, then you'll be able to knock
down a mountain fortress with one blow of your fist, you'll be
able to topple a cliff-top temple with a single kick. It's like a
great mass of fire; approach it, and it will burn off your face. It's
like the T'ai Ya Sword; fool around with it and you lose your
body and life. For this one, only those who have penetrated
through and gained the great liberation will be able to act like
this. Otherwise, if you miss the source and get stuck in the
words, you definitely won't be able to grasp this kind of talk.
"Responsive preaching comes to scornful detraction." This
then is 'one guest, one host, one question, one answer.' Ri gh t
in the asking and answering, there's the scornful detraction.
It's called "responsive preaching comes to scornful detrac­
tion." Hsueh Tau has deep knowledge of this matter, so he can
complete his verse in only two lines.
At the end it's just Hsueh Tau going down into the weeds to
explain things thoroughly for you. "Chick and mother hen do
not know each other; who is it that breaks in and breaks out
together?" Although the mother hen breaks in, she cannot
cause the chick to break out; although the chick breaks out, he
cannot cause the mother hen to break in. Neither is aware of
the other. At the moment of breaking in and breaking out, who
is it that breaks in and breaks out together?
If you understand this way, you still haven't been able to get

Sixteenth Case

109

beyond Hsueh Tou's final line. Why? Haven't you heard
Hsiang Yen's saying,
The chick breaks out, the mother hen breaks in­
When the chick awakens, there is no shell.
Chick and hen both forgotten,
Response to circumstance is unerring.
On the same path, chanting in harmony,
Through the marvelous mystery, walking a lone.
Nevertheless Hsueh Tou comes down into the weeds and
creates entangling complications by saying, "A peck." This
one word praises Ching Ch'ing's answer, "Can you live or
not?" "He awakens" praises the monk's reply, "If I weren't
alive, I'd be laughed at by people." Whey then does Hsueh Tou
go ahead and say, "He's still in the shell"? Hsueh Tou can
distinguish initiated from uninitiated in the light of a stone­
struck spark; he can discern the clue to the whole thing in the
flash of a lightening bolt.
Ching Ch'ing said, "You too are a man in the weeds." Hsueh
Tou says, "Once again he receives a blow." This difficult part
is correct. Ching Ch'ing said, "You too are a man in the
weeds." Can this be called snatching the man's eyeballs away?
Doesn't this line mean he's still in the shell? But this has
nothing to do with it. How so? If you don't understand, you can
travel on foot all over the world and still not be able to requite
your debt. When I talk like this, I too am a man in the weeds.
"All the patchrobed monks in the world name and describe
it in vain." Who doesn't name and describe? At this point,
Hsueh Tou himself cannot name or describe it, yet he drags in
others, the patchrobed monks of the world. But tell me, how
did Ching Ch'ing help this monk? No patchrobed monk in the
world can leap out.

a.

Expressions such as 'solitary and steep,' 'solitary and dangerous
(high)' are used to describe the method of an adept who is bringing
up 'the true imperative,' likened to a steep and precipitous moun­
tain peak which is unapproachable, offering no hand or foot hold,
nothing to grasp. It is dangerous because if you approach you may
lose your life.

SEVENTEENTH CASE

Hsiang Lin's Meaning of the Coming
from the West

POINTER

Cut through nails and shear through iron, then you can be a
genuine master of our school. If you run away from arrows and
avoid swords, how could you possibly be a competent adept?
The place where even a needle cannot enter, I leave aside for
now; but tell me, what's it like when the foamy waves are
flooding the skies? To test, I cite this; look!

CASE

A monk asked Hsiang Lin, "What is the meaning of the Patri­

arch's coming from the West?"1
Hsiang Lin said, "Sitting for a long time becomes toil­
some."2·a

NOTES

1.

There have been many people with doubts about this; there is
still news of this around.

2.

When a fish swims through, the water is muddied; when a bird
flies by, feathers drop down. Better shut that dog's mouth. The
eye of an adept. A saw cutting apart a scale beam."

COMMENTARY

Hsiang Lin says, "Sittmg for a long time becomes toilsome."
Understand? If you do understand, then you can put down your
shield and spear on the hundred grasses. If you don't under­
stand, then listen humbly to this treatment.

Seventeenth Case

When the Ancients travelled on foot, forming associations
with chosen friends to travel together as companions on the
Path, they would pull out the weeds and look for the way. At
the time Yun Men was causing the teaching to flourish
throughout Kuang Nan. Hsiang Lin had made his way by stages
out of Shu (Ssuchuan). He was contemporary with E Hu and
Ching Ch'ing. He first went to Pao Tz'u Temple in Hunan;
only later did he come to Yun Men's congregation, where he
was an attendant for eighteen years.
At Yun Men's place he personally attained and personally
heard; though the time of his enlightenment was late, never­
theless he was a man of great faculties. He stayed at Yun Men's
side for eighteen years; time and again Yun Men would just call
out to him, "Attendant Yuan!" As soon as he responded, Yun
Men would say, "What is it?" At such times, no matter how
much (Hsiang Lin) spoke to present his understanding and gave
play to his spirit, he never reached mutual accord (with Yun
Men). One day, though, he suddenly said, "I understand." Yun
Men said, "Why don't you say something above and beyond
this?" Hsiang Lin stayed on for another three years. Yun Men's
eloquent elucidations of states uttered in his room were mostly
so that Attendant Yuan could enter in actively wherever he
was. Whenever Yun Men had some saying or remark, they
were all gathered by Attendant Yuan."
Later Hsiang Lin returned to Shu, where he stayed at the
Crystal Palace Temple on Ch'ing Ch'eng Mountain.
Master Chih Men Tso was originally from Chekiang. Filled
with what he had heard of Hsiang Lin teaching the Path, he
came especially to Shu to meet him and pay homage. Tso was
Hsueh Tou's master. Though Yun Men converted people with­
out number, of all the wayfarers of that generation, Hsiang
Lin's stream flourished most. After he came back to Shu, he
lived in temples (teaching) for forty years; he didn't pass on
until he was eighty. He once said, "Only when I was forty did I
attain unity."
Ordinarily he would teach his assembly saying, "Whenever
you go travelling on foot to search for men of knowledge, you
must bring along the eye to distinguish initiate from uniniti­
ate, to tell shallow from deep, then you'll be all right. First you
must establish your resolve, just as old man Shakyamuni did
when he was in the causal ground; wherever he thought or
spoke, it was always to set his resolve."

112

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Later a monk asked, "What is the saucer-lamp within the
room? "ct Lin said, "If three people testify that it's a turtle, then
it's a turtle." Again he asked, "What is the affair underneath
the patched robe?" Lin said, "The conflagration of the end of
time burns up the mountain."
Since the old days, very many answers have been given for
the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West. Only
Hsiang Lin, right here in this case, has cut off the tongues of
everyone on earth; there is no place for you to calculate or
make up rationalizations. The monk asked, "What is the
meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West?" Lin said,
"Sitting for a long time becomes toilsome." This could be
called flavorless words, flavorless phrases; flavorless talk
blocks off people's mouths and leaves you no place to show
your energy. If you would see, then just see immediately. If you
don't see, it's urgent you avoid entertaining intellectual under­
standing.
Hsiang Lin had encountered an adept; consequently he pos­
sessed Yun Men's technique and harmonious mastery of the
'three phrases' (of Yun Men). People often misunderstand and
say, "The Patriarch came from the West and sat facing a wall
for nine years; isn't this sitting for a long time and becoming
weary?" What is there to hold on to? They don't see that the
Ancient Hsiang Lin had attained the realm of great indepen­
dence, that his feet tread upon the real earth; without so many
views and theories of Buddha Dharma, he could meet the situa­
tion and function accordingly. As it is said, "The Teaching is
carried on according to facts; the banner of the Teaching is set
up according to the situation."
Hsueh Tou uses this wind to fan the fire, and from his posi­
tion as a bystander points out one or a half:

VERSE

One, two, a thousand, ten thousand;
**Why not practice accordingly!
As plentiful as hemp and millet;
why are they congregating into a crowd!*
Strip off the blinders, unload the saddle bags.
**From today on, you must be purified, clean
and at ease. Can you rest yet, or noU *

Seventeenth Case

113

Turning to the left, turning to the right, following up behind;
*You still can't let yourself go. Reflections upon reflec­
tions, echoes upon echoes. I strike!

•

Tzu Hu had to hit Iron Grindstone Liu.
**I'd break the staff and no longer carry
out this order. He draws his bow after
the thief has gone, so I strike. Danger!

•

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou strikes directly, like sparks struck from stone, like
the brilliance of a flash of lightening; he presses out and re­
leases to get you to see, which you can do only if you under­
stand it immediately as soon as you hear it being brought up.
Undeniably Hsueh Tou is a descendant of Hsiang Lin's
house; thus he is able to talk this way. If you can directly and
immediately understand in this way, then nothing can stop
you from being extraordinary.
"One, two, a thousand, ten thousand; strip off the blinders,
unload the saddle bags." Purified, clean and at ease, they are
not stained by birth and death, they are not bound by emo­
tional interpretations of sanctity and profanity. Above, there's
nothing to look to for support; below, they've cut off their
personal selves. They're just like Hsiang Lin and Hsueh Tou;
how could there be just a thousand or ten thousand? In fact all
the people in the world, each and every one, are all like this.
The past and future Buddhas are all like this too.
If you make up interpretative understandings on the words,
then this is like "Tzu Hu had to hit Iron Grindstone Liu." In
fact, as soon as (such interpretations) are raised, Hsueh Tou
strikes while you are still speaking. Tzu Hu studied under Nan
Ch'uan; he was a fellow student of Chao Chou and Tiger Ts'en
(Ch'ang Sha). At that time Iron Grindstone Liu had set up a hut
on Mt. Kuei. People from all over couldn't cope with her. One
day Tzu Hu came proudly to call on her; he asked, "You're Iron
Grindstone Liu, aren't you?" The Grindstone said, "I don't
presume (to say so)." Hu asked, "Do you turn to the left or turn
to the right?" The Grindstone said, "Don't tip over, Teacher."
Hu struck her while her words were still in the air.
Answering the monk who asked, "What is the meaning of
the Patriarch's coming from the West?" Hsiang Lin said, "Sit-

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

114

ting for a long time becomes toilsome." If you understand this
way, you are "turning to the left, turning to the right, following
up behind." But tell me, what is Hsueh Tau's meaning inver­
sifying like this?

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

a.

Hsiang Lin's reply could also be glossed as "sitting for a long time
becomes tiring," or "sitting for a long time becomes hard work."
Tenkei said, "When you sit for a long time your legs hurt: it's
nothing special-the eyes are horizontal, the nose vertical;
though everyone knows, because they are not aware of it (Hsiang
Lin) just lets everyone know that they breathe through their
noses. Is there any patriarch's meaning in there? If you call it an
answer as to the meaning of the coming from the West, it's a
worthless bag, a worn-out loincloth." A popular legend has it
that Bodhidharma's legs crumbled to dust as he sat still for nine
years facing a wall at the Shao Lin monastery. Dagen said that the
Way is actually realized by the body. This kung an should not be
applied to person only, but also to things. The "ground of reality"
which one must tread to see this case could also be glossed as
"real earth" from a certain point of view.

b.

According to commentators, this means that it is hard to pene­
trate.

c.

It is said that Yun Men forbade the recording of his words; how­
ever, Hsiang Lin stealthily wrote them down on his paper robe.
They were compiled by Shou Chien, another of Yun Men's suc­
cessors.

d.

The lamp symbolizes wisdom; the room symbolizes stability.
Without the stability of meditation, the flame of wisdom is blown
by the wind of passion.

EIGHTEENTH CASE

National Teacher Chung's Seamless
Monument

CASE

Emperor Su Tsung1 asked National Teacher Hui Chung, "After
you die, what will you need?"2
The National Teacher said, "Build a seamless monument for
me."3
The Emperor said, "Please tell me, Master, what the monu­
ment would look like."4
The National Teacher was silent for a long time; then he
asked, "Do you understand?"5
The Emperor said, "I don't understand."6
The National Teacher said, "I have a disciple to whom I
have transmitted the Teaching, Tan Yuan, who is well versed
in this matter. Please summon him and ask him about it."'
After the National Teacher passed on,8 the Emperor summoned Tan Yuan and asked him what the meaning of this
was.9 Tan Yuan said,
South of Hsiang, north of T'an; 10
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "A single hand does
not make random sound."11
In between there's gold sufficient to a nation.12
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "A rough-hewn
staf£."13
Beneath the shadowless tree, the community fer­
ryboat; 14
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "The sea is calm,
the rivers are clear."15
Within the crystal palace, there's no one who
knows.16
Hsueh Tou added the comment, "He has raised it
up."17

NOTES

l. This is a mistake; actually it was Tai Tsung.
2. He scratches before it itches. As it turns out, (Hui Chung) will

create a model and draw a likeness; though great and venerable,
he acts this way-he shouldn't point to the east as the west."
3. It can't be grasped.

4. He gives (Chung) a good poke.
5. Confined in prison, he increases in wisdom. After all he points to

the east as the west and takes the south as the north. All he can do
is frown.
6. It's fortunate that he doesn't understand;

if he had pressed

(Chung) further at this time and made him gulp a mouthful of
frost, then he would have gotten somewhere.
7. He's lucky that the Emperor did not overturn his meditation seat;

why didn't (Chung) give him some of his own provisions? Don't
confuse the man. (Chung) let the initiative go.
8. What a pity! After all (the Emperor) will mistakenly go by the zero

point of the scale.
9. The son takes up the father's work. He too falls into the second

level, into the third level.
10. This too can't be grasped. Two by two, three by three-what are

you doing? Half open, half closed.
11.

One blind man leading a crowd of blind men. After all (Hsueh
Tou) is following his words to produce interpretations. Why fol­
low falsehood and pursue evil?

12. Above is the sky, below is the earth. I've had no such news.

Whose concern is this?
13. It's been broken. This too is creating a model and drawing a like­

ness.
14. The Patriarch has perished. What are you saying, Reverend?
15. When vast swells of expansive white waves flood the skies, this

still only amounts to a little bit.
16. Bah!
17. He draws his bow after the thief has gone. The words are still in

our ears.

COMMENTARY

Su Tsung and Tai Tsung were both descendants of Hsuan
Tsung. When they were princes, they were always fond of

Eighteenth Case

117

studying meditation. Because there was a great upheaval in his
realm/ Hsuan Tsung finally fled to Shu. The Tang dynasty
originally had its capital at Ch'ang An; but because it was
occupied by An Lu Shan, later (the capital) was moved to Lo
Yang.
When Su Tsung came to power, National Teacher Chung
was dwelling in a hut on White Cliff Mountain in Teng Chou
(in Hunan). Today this is the Fragrant Cliff (Hsiang Yen) mon­
astery. Though he did not come down from the mountain for
more than forty years, word of his practice of the Way reached
the Imperial precincts. In

761 the Emperor Su Tsung sent his

personal emissary to summon Chung to enter the Imperial pal­
ace (to teach). The Emperor treated Chung with the etiquette
due a teacher, and greatly honored him. Chung once lectured
on the Supreme Path for the Emperor. When the Master de­
parted from court, the Emperor himself escorted his carriage
and saw him off. The courtiers were all angry at this and
wanted to make their displeasure known to the Emperor. But
the National Teacher had the power to know the minds of
others, so he saw the Emperor first and told him, "In the pres­
ence of Indra, I have seen Emperors scattered like grains, eva­
nescent as a flash of lightning." The Emperor respected him
even more after this.
When Tai Tsung succeeded to the throne (in 762) he again
invited (Chung) to come to the Abode of Light Temple. Chung
stayed in the capital for sixteen years, expounding the Dharma
according to the occasion, until he passed on in 776.
Formerly the Master of Blue File Mountain in Shan Man Fu
had been the National Teacher's travelling companion. The
National Teacher once asked the Emperor to summon him to
court, but he did not rise to three Imperial commands; he
would always upbraid the National Teacher for being addicted
to fame and fortune, and for liking the company of people.
Chung was National Teacher under two emperors, father
and son. In that family father and son studied meditation at the
same time. According to the Record of the Transmission of the
Lamp, it was Tai Tsung who asked the questions in the present
case. When the National Teacher was asked, "What is the
Ten-Body Controller?" (case 99), this on the other hand was Su
Tsung's question.
When the National Teacher's life was over and he was about
to enter nirvana, he was taking leave of Tai Tsung. Tai Tsung

118

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

asked, "After your death/ what will you need?" This is just an
ordinary question. The old fellow (Chung) stirred up waves
where there was no wind and said, "Build a seamless monu­
ment for me." Under the bright sun and blue sky, why answer
like this? It should have been enough to build a monument;
why then did he say to build a seamless monument? But Tai
Tsung too was an adept: he pressed him and said, "Please tell
me, Master, what the monument would look like?" The Na­
tional Teacher remained silent for a long time, then said, "Do
you understand?" How extraordinary this little bit is; it's most
difficult to approach. When pressed by the Emperor, the Na­
tional Teacher, supposedly so great, could only frown. Al­
though this is so, anyone but this old fellow (Chung) would
probably have been bowled over.
Quite a few people say that the National Teacher's not
speaking is itself what the monument is like. If you understand
in this fashion, Bodhidharma and all his family would be wiped
off the face of the earth. If you say that keeping silent is it, then
mutes too must understand Ch'an.
Haven't you heard how an outsider asked the Buddha, "I
don't ask about the spoken, I don't ask about the unspoken."
The World Honored One remained silent. The outsider bowed
in homage and sighed in praise; he said, "The World Honored
One's great mercy and great compassion has dispersed the
clouds of my delusions and caused me to gain entry." After the
outsider had left, Ananda asked the Buddha, "What did the
outsider witness, that he said he had gained entry?" The World
Honored One said, "In worldly terms he's like a good horse; he
goes when he sees the shadow of the whip." People often go to
the silence for their understanding. What is there to grasp?
My late teacher Wu Tsu brought up (the 'seamless monu­
ment') and said, "In front it is pearls and agate, in back it is
agate and pearls; on the east are Avalokitesvara and Mahas­
thamaprapta, on the west are Manjusri and Samantabhadra;ct in
the middle there's a flag blown by the wind, saying 'Flap,
flap."'
The National Teacher asked, "Do you understand?" The
Emperor said, "I don't understand," yet he had attained a little
bit. But tell me, is this "I don't understand" the same as Em­
peror Wu's "I don't know" (case 1), or is it different? Although
they seem the same, actually they're not.

Eighteenth Case

119

The National Teacher said, "I have a disciple to whom I
have transmitted the Teaching, Tan Yuan, who is well versed
in this matter. Please summon him and ask him about it."
Putting aside Tai Tsung's not understanding for the moment,
did Tan Yuan understand? All that was needed was to say,
"Please, Teacher, what would the monument look like?"-no
one in the world can do anything about it. My late teacher Wu
Tsu commented by saying, "You are the teacher of a whole
nation; why is it that you don't speak, but instead defer to your
disciple?"
After the National Teacher died, the Emperor summoned
Tan Yuan, to ask about the meaning of this. Tan Yuan then
came on behalf of the National Teacher and explained the
principle with foreign words and native speech; naturally he
understood what the National Teacher had said, and just
needed a single verse (to explain):
South of Hsiang, north of Tan:e
Within there's gold sufficient to a nation.
Beneath the shadowless tree, the community fer­
ryboat;
Within the crystal palace, there's no one who
knows.
Tan Yuan, whose name was Ying Chen, served as an atten­
dant at the National Teacher's place. Later he dwelt at Tan
Yuan Temple in Chi Chou (in Kiangsi). At this time Yang Shan
came to see Tan Yuan. Tan Yuan's words were severe, his
nature harsh and unapproachable. It was impossible to stay
there, so at first Yang Shan went and saw the Ch'an master
Hsing K'ung. There was a monk who asked Hsing K'ung,
"What is the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West?" Hsing K'ung said, "It's as if a man were down in a
thousand foot deep well; if you could get this man out without
using even an inch of rope, then I would tell you the meaning
of the Patriarch's coming from the West." The monk said,
"These days Master Ch'ang of Hunan is talking this way and
that for people too." Hsing K'ung then called to Yang Shan,
"Novice, drag this corpse out of here!"
Later Yang Shan took this up with Tan Yuan and asked,
"How can you get the man out of the well?" Tan Yuan s aid,
"Bah! Ignoramus! Who is in the well?" Yang Shan didn't under-

120

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

stand. Later he asked Kuei Shan. Kuei Shan immediately called
out (Yang Shan's name) "Hui Chi!" When Yang Shan re­
sponded, Kuei Shan said, "He's out." At this Yang Shan was
greatly enlightened. He said, "At Tan Yuan's I attained the
essence; at Kuei Shan's I attained the function."
As for this little verse of Tan Yuan's, it has led not a few
people into false interpretations. People often misunderstand
and say,
the

"Hsiang is the hsiang of 'meet' (hsiang-chien); T'an is
t'an of 'discuss' (t'an-lun). In between there's a seamless

memorial tower, hence the verse says, 'In between there's gold
sufficient to a nation.' 'Beneath the shadowless tree, the com­
munity ferryboat' is the interchange between the National
Teacher and the Emperor. The Emperor did not understand, so
the verse says, 'Inside the crystal palace there's no one who
knows.' "
Again, some say, "The first line means south of Hsiang
Chou and north of T'an Chou; 'In between there's gold suffi­
cient to a nation' praises the Emperor." Then they blink their
eyes, look around, and say, "This is the seamless monument."
If you understand in such a way, you have not gone beyond
emotional views.
As for Hsueh Tau's four turning words, how will you under­
stand them? People today are far from knowing the Ancient's
meaning. Tell me, how do you understand "South of Hsiang,
north of T'an"? How do you understand "Within there's gold
sufficient to a nation"? How do you understand "Beneath the
shadowless tree, the community ferryboat"? How do you un­
derstand "Within the crystal palace, there's no one who
knows"? If you can see this as Hsueh Tou and I do, nothing can
prevent a whole life of joy and happiness.
"South of Hsiang, north of T'an." Hsueh Tou says, "A single
hand does not make a random sound." He couldn't but explain
for you. "Within there's gold sufficient to a nation." Hsueh
Tou says, "A rough-hewn staff." An Ancient said, "If you know
the staff, the work of your whole life's study is complete."
"Beneath the shadowless tree, the community ferry." Hsueh
Tou says, "The sea is calm, the rivers are clear." Open the
windows and doors all at once-on all sides gleaming clarity.
"Inside the crystal palace, there's no one who knows." Hsueh
Tou says, "He's raised it." After all he's gotten somewhere.
Hsueh Tou has spoken clearly all at once; afterwards he simply
eulogizes the seamless monument.

COMMENTARY

Right off Hsueh Tou says, "The seamless monument-To see
it is hard." Though it stands alone revealed with nothing hid­
den, when you want to see it, it's still hard to do so. Hsueh Tou
is exceedingly compassionate, and tells you more: "A clear
pool does not admit the blue dragon's coils." My late master
Wu Tsu said, "In Hsueh Tau's whole volume of eulogies on the
ancients, I just like the line, 1A clear pool does not admit the
blue dragon's coils.' 1' Still1 this amounts to something.
Quite a few people go to the National Teacher's silence for
their sustenance; if you understand in this way, you at once go
wrong. Haven1t you heard it said, 11Reclining dragons aren't to
be seen in stagnant water; where they are not, there's moon-

light and the ripples settle, but where they are, waves arise
without wind." Again, it was said, "Reclining dragons always
fear the blue pool's clarity." As for this fellow Hsueh Tau, even
if vast swelling billows of white waves flooded the sky, he still
wouldn't coil up in there.
When Hsueh Tau gets to this, his verse is finished. After­
wards he applies a little bit of eye and carves a seamless
monument. Following up behind he says, "Layers upon layers,
Shadows upon shadows-For ever and ever it is shown to
people." How will you look upon it? Where is it right now?
Even if you see it clearly, don't mistakenly stick by the zero
point of the scale.

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

The three clauses of this sentence can be taken in reference to the
Emperor or to Hui Chung. In the original these notes of Yuan
Wu's are inserted right in the text; though they usually refer to
the preceding passage, occasionally they apply to the succeeding
sentence. The pronoun 'he'-absent in the original but added by
the translator for grammatical English-normally refers to the
same subject as the clause noted. Commentators frequently point
out that it applies to you too.

b.

In 755 the military man An Lushan, commander of powerful bor­
der armies on China's northern frontier, began a revolt aimed at
supplanting the T'ang dynasty with his own regime. The fighting
dragged on for more than five years, even after An Lushan himself
had died, ravaging much of northern China, and dealing the ruling
house of T'ang a blow from which it never fully recovered. There­
after the sufferings of the people increased as rival military com­
manders struggled with each other and with the Imperial court for
control of the revenues of the land. Hsuan Tsung fled from the
capital Ch'ang An to the city of Ch'eng Tu in Szechuan (ancient
Shu) in western China-a traditional route of flight before north­
ern invaders.

c.
d.

The polite expression used is "after a hundred years."
Avalokitesvara represents compassion, Mahasthamaprapta repre­
sents empowerment, Manjusri represents wisdom and knowl­
edge, and Samantabhadra represents goodness in all actions.

e.

Hsiang-T'an was a district in Hunan, south of Ch'ang Sha. "South
of Hsiang and north of T'an" can mean everywhere, or nowhere.

Chu Ti's One-Finger Ch'an

POINTER

When one speck of dust arises, the great earth is contained
therein; when a single flower blooms, the world arises. But
before the speck of dust is raised, before the flower opens, how
will you set eyes on it? Therefore it is said, "It's like cutting a
skein of thread: when one strand is cut, all are cut. It's like
dyeing a skein of thread: when one strand is dyed, all are dyed."
This very moment you should take all complications and
cut them off. Bring out your own family jewels and respond
everywhere, high and low, before and after, without missing.
Each and every one will be fully manifest. If you're not yet like
this, look into the text below.

CASE

Whenever anything was asked, 1 Master Chu Ti would just
raise one finger.2

NOTES

1.

What news is there? Dull-witted teacher!

2.

This old fellow too would c ut off the tongues of everyone on
earth. When it's warm, all heaven and earth are warm; when it's
cold, all heaven and earth are cold. He snatches away the tongues
of everyone on earth.

COMMENTARY

If you understand at the finger, then you turn your back on Chu
Ti; if you don't go to the finger to understand, then it's like cast
iron. Whether you understand or not, Chu Ti still goes on this
way; whether you're high or low, he still goes on this way;
123

124

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

whether you're right or wrong, he still goes on this way. Thus
it is said, "As soon as a speck of dust arises, the great earth is
contained therein; when a single flower is about to open, the
world immediately comes into being. The lion on the tip of a
single hair appears on the tips of ten billion hairs."
Yuan Ming said, "When it's cold, all throughout heaven and
earth are cold; when it's warm, all throughout heaven and
earth are warm." The mountains and rivers and the great earth
reach down through the Yellow Springs (Hades); the myriad
images and multitude of forms penetrate upward through the
heavens. But tell me, what is so extraordinary? For those who
know, it's not worth taking hold of; for those who don't know,
it blocks them off utterly.
Master Chu Ti was from Chin Hua in Wu Chou (in
Chekiang). During the time he first dwelt in a hermitage, there
was a nun named Shih Chi ('Reality') who came to his hut.
When she got there she went straight in; without taking off her
rain hat she walked around his meditation seat three times
holding her staff. "If you can speak," she said, "I'll take off my
rain hat." She questioned him like this three times; Chu Ti had
no reply. Then as she was leaving Chu Ti said, "The hour is
rather late: would you stay the night?" The nun said, "If you
can speak, I'll stay over." Again Chu Ti had no reply. The nun
then walked out. Chu Ti sighed sorrowfully and said, "Al­
though I inhabit the body of a man, still I lack a man's spirit."
After this he aroused his zeal to clarify this matter.
He meant to abandon his hermitage and travel to various
places to call on teachers to ask for instruction, and had
wrapped up his things for foot-travelling. But that night the
spirit of the mountain told him, "You don't have to leave this
place. Tomorrow a flesh and blood bodhisattva will come and
expound the truth for you, Master. You don't have to go." As it
turned out, the following day Master T'ien Lung actually came
to the hermitage. Chu Ti welcomed him ceremoniously and
gave a full account of the previous events. T'ien Lung just lifted
up one finger to show him; suddenly Chu Ti was greatly en­
lightened. At the time Chu Ti was most earnest and single­
minded, so the bottom of his bucket fell out easily. Later,
whenever anything was asked, Chu Ti just raised one finger.
Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "Delicious food is not for a satisfied

Nineteenth Case

man to eat." Hsuan Sha said, "If I had seen him then, I would
have broken the finger off." Hsuan Chueh said, "When Hsuan
Sha spoke this way, what was his meaning?" Hsi of Yun Chu
said, "When Hsuan Sha spoke this way, was he agreeing with
Chu Ti or not? If he agreed with him, why did he speak of
breaking off the finger? If he didn't agree with him, where was
Chu Ti's mistake?" The Former Ts'ao Shan said, "Chu Ti's
realization was crude: he only recognized one device, one
perspective. Like everyone else, he claps his hands and slaps
his palms, but I look upon Hsi Yuan as exceptional."a Again,
Hsuan Chueh said, "But say, was Chu Ti enlightened or not?
Why was Chu Ti's realization crude?" If he wasn't enlightened,
how could he say, "My whole life I've used one-finger Ch'an
without ever exhausting it"? Tell me, where is Ts'ao Shan's
meaning?
At that time, Chu Ti actually did not understand. After his
enlightenment, whenever anything was asked, Chu Ti would
just raise one finger; why couldn't a thousand people, even ten
thousand people, entrap him or break him apart? If you under­
stand it as a finger, you definitely won't see the Ancient's
meaning. This kind of Ch'an is easy to approach but hard to
understand. People these days who just hold up a finger or a fist
as soon as they're questioned are just indulging their spirits. It
is still necessary to pierce the bone, penetrate to the marrow,
and see all the way through in order to get it.
At Chu Ti's hermitage there was a servant boy. While he
was away from the hermitage, he was asked, "What method
does your master usually use to teach people?" The servant boy
held up a finger. When he returned, he mentioned this to the
Master. Chu Ti took a knife and cut off the boy's finger; as he
ran out screaming, Chu Ti called to him. The boy looked back,
whereupon Chu Ti raised his finger; the boy opened up and
attained understanding. Tell me, what truth did he see?
When he was nearing death, Chu Ti said to his assembly, "I
attained T'ien Lung's one-finger Ch'an and have used it all my
life without exhausting it. Do you want to understand?" He
raised his finger, then died.
The One-Eyed Dragon of Ming Chao asked his 'uncle,' Shen
of Kuo T'ai, "An Ancient said that Chu Ti just recited a three
line spell and thereby became more famous than anyone else.

126

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

How can you quote the three line spell for someone else?"
Shen also raised one finger. Chao said, "If not for Today, how
could I know this borderlands traveller?" Tell me, what does
this mean?

,
Mi Mo just used a forked branch all his life. The Earth­
Beating Teacher would just hit the ground once whenever any­

thing was asked. Once someone hid his staff and then asked,
"What is Buddha?" The Teacher just opened his mouth wide.
These (methods) too were used for a whole lifetime without
ever being exhausted.
Wu Yeh said, "The Patriarch (Bodhidharma) observed that
our country had people with the potential to be vessels of the
Great Vehicle. He transmitted only the mind seal, in order to
instruct those on the paths of illusion. Those who attain it do
not choose between ignorance and wisdom, between worldly
and holy. Much falsehood is not as good as a little truth. Any­
one who is powerful will immediately rest right this moment
and abruptly still the myriad entanglements, thus passing be­
yond the stream of birth and death and going far beyond the
usual patterns. Though you have family and estate, if you do
not seek, it is attained of itself." Throughout his whole
lifetime, whenever anything was asked, Wu Yeh would just
say, "Don't think falsely!" Thus it is said, "Penetrate one
place, and at once you penetrate a thousand places, ten
thousand places. Clearly understand one device, and at once
you clearly understand a thousand devices, ten thousand de­
vices."
Generally people these days are not this way; they just in­
dulge in conceptual and emotional interpretations, and don't
understand what is most essential with these Ancients. How
could Chu Ti have had no other devices to switch to? Why did
he just employ one finger? You must realize that here is where
Chu Ti helps people so profoundly and intimately.
Do you want to understand how to save strength? Go back
to Yuan Ming's saying, "When it's cold, all throughout heaven
and earth is cold; when it's warm, all throughout heaven and
earth is warm." Mountains, rivers, and earth, extending up­
ward to the solitary heights; myriad forms in profuse array
penetrate down through dangerous precipices. Where will you
find one finger Ch'an?

Nineteenth Case

VERSE

For his appropriate teaching I deeply admire old Chu Ti;
• • A leper drags along his companions. Only those on
the same path know. Nevertheless it's (only) one
device, one perspective. •

Since space and time have been emptied, who else is there?
• *Two, three-there's still one more. He too should
be struck dead. •
Having cast a piece of driftwood onto the ocean,
• *It's all this. So it is, but it's too
inaccessible. Worn out straw sandals; what
use does it have? •

Together in the night waves we take in blind turtles.
• • Dragging the sky, searching the earth; what end
will there be? When we take them in, what are they

good for? We act according to what is imperative.
I'd drive them towards a world where there is no
Buddha. I've taken you in, Reverend, one blind man. •

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou has mastered literary composition; he's consum­
mately accomplished. He especially likes to make up verses for
obscure and unusual public cases. For students of today he
censures and praises the Ancients; as guest or host, with a
question or an answer, he holds them up before you-this is
how he helps people. Thus he says, "For his appropriate teach­
ing I deeply admire old Chu Ti." Tell me, why does Hsueh Tou
admire him? Since heaven and earth began, who else has
there ever been? Just this one, old Chu Ti. If it had been anyone
else, inevitably he would have been inconsistent; only Chu Ti
just used one finger up until his old age and death.
People often interpret this wrongly and say, "Mountains,
rivers, and the great earth are empty; man is empty; the
Dharma is empty too. Even if time and space were emptied out
all at once, it's just this one, old Chu Ti." But this has nothing
to do with it.

128

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"Having cast a piece of driftwood onto the ocean." Nowa­
days they call this the ocean of birth and death. Within the
ocean of doing, sentient beings appear and disappear without
understanding themselves clearly, without hope of getting out.
Old Chu Ti extends his mercy to take people in; in the ocean of
birth and death he uses one finger to rescue others. It's like
letting down a piece of driftwood to rescue a blind turtle. He
enables all sentient beings to reach the Other Shore.
"Together in the night waves we take in blind turtles." The
Lotus Scripture says, "It's like a one-eyed turtle sticking his
nose through a hole in a floating board."b When a great man of
knowledge receives a fellow who is like a dragon or a tiger, he
directs him towards a world where there is Buddha to act in
turn as guest and host, and in worlds without Buddhas to cut
off the essential way across. Having taken in a blind turtle,
what use is it?

Once when Ch'an master T'an Tsang of Hsi Yuan, a successor of
Ma Tsu, was making the fire to heat the bath, one of his disciples
told him that such menial tasks should be done by one of the
novices. The Master said nothing, but clapped his hands three
times.

The metaphor: a blind turtle surfacing at the precise moment a
piece of driftwood with a hole in it is passing by; the turtle can
climb through the hole up out of the sea. This symbolizes the rare
opportunity of hearing the Buddhist Teaching while in human
form, itself a rare opportunity.

Lung Ya's Meaning of the Coming
from the West

POINTER

Piled in mountains, heaped in ranges, up against walls, pressed
against barriers; if you linger in thought, holding back your
potential, you'll be bitterly cramped.
Or else, a man may appear and overturn the great ocean,
kick over Mount Sumeru, scatter the white clouds with
shouts, and break up empty space; straightaway, with one de­
vice, one object, he cuts off the tongues of everyone on earth, so
that there is no way for you to approach. Tell me, since ancient
times, who has ever been this way? To test, I cite this; look!

CASE

Lung Ya asked Ts'ui Wei, "What is the meaning of the Pa­
triarch's coming from the West?"1
Wei said, "Pass me the meditation brace."2
Ya gave the meditation brace to Wei;3 Wei took it and hit
him.4
Ya said, "Since you hit me I let you hit me. In essence,
though, there is no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West."5
Ya also asked Lin Chi, "What is the meaning of the Pa­
triarch's coming from the West?"6
Chi said, "Pass me the cushion."7
Ya took the cushion and handed it to Lin Chi;8 Chi took it
and hit him. 9
Ya said, "Since you hit me I let you hit me. In essence,
though, there is no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West."10

NOTES

1. It's an old public case known everywhere; still he wants to put it

to the test.
2. What will he use the meditation brace for? (Ts'ui Wei) almost let

(Lung Ya) go. Danger!
3. He can't hold on to it; (Lung Ya) is given a fine steed, Green

Dragon, but he doesn't know how to ride it. What a pity that he
doesn't take charge right away.
4. Got him! What is accomplished by hitting a dead man? He too has

fallen into the secondary.
5. This fellow's talk is in the secondary; he draws his bow after the

thief has gone.
6. Again he inquires into the commonplace old public case; it's not

worth half a cent.
7. If the waves of Ts'ao Ch'i resembled each other, endless numbers

of ordinary people would get bogged down. One punishment for
all crimes; they're buried in the same pit.
8. As before, he can't hold on to it; as before he's not very clever.

What's like the land of Yueh is like Yang Chou.•
9. Got him! What a pity to be hitting this kind of dead man. Lin Chi

comes out of the same pattern as Ts'ui Wei.
10. Obviously. He's making a living inside the demon cave. He

thinks he's gained the advantage.

COMMENTARY

Master Chih of Ts'ui Yen said, "It was so at that time, but do
patchrobed monks these days still have blood under their
skin?"
Che of Mt. Kuei said, "Ts'ui Wei and Lin Chi can be called
genuine masters of our sect."
Lung Ya was first rate at pulling out the weeds seeking the
way; there's no reason why he shouldn't serve as a model for
people of later times. After he had a fixed abode, a monk asked
him, "Teacher, at that time did you agree with those two ven­
erable adepts?" Ya said, "I agree, as far as agreement goes; it's
just that there is no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from
the West." Lung Ya looks carefully in front and behind, and
dispenses medicine to suit the disease.

Twentieth Case

131

Ta Kuei, however, is not this way; when asked whether
Lung Ya had agreed with the two venerable adepts, whether he
understood or not, he would have brought his staff down across
the back (of the questioner). This not only supports Ts'ui Wei
and Lin Chi, but also doesn't turn away from the questioner.
Ts'ung of Shih Men said, "Lung Ya is still all right if there's
no one to press him, but when he's pressed by a patchrobed
one, he loses one eye."
Hsueh Tou said, "Lin Chi and Ts'ui Wei only knew how to
hold still; they didn't know how to let go. If I had been Lung Ya
at that time, when they asked for the cushion and meditation
brace, I would have picked it up and immediately thrown it
down right in front of them."
Wu Tsu Shih Chieh said, "The Teacher has such a long
face!" He also said, "The patriarchal masters' star of ill-omen is
over his head."
Hsin of Huang Lung Mountain said, "Lung Ya drove off the
ploughman's ox, he snatched away the hungry man's food.
Once he's clear, he's clear; why then is there no meaning of the
Patriarch's coming from the West? Do you understand? On the
staff there is an eye bright as the sun; to tell whether gold is
real, see it through fire."
To extol the wonder of the essential, to advocate the funda­
mental vehicle, if you can understand it the very first instant,
then you can cut off the tongues of everyone on earth. But if
you vacillate, you fall into the secondary. These two old fel­
lows Lin Chi and Ts'ui Wei, though they beat the wind and hit
the rain, startle heaven and shake the earth, have never really
hit a clear eyed fellow.
When the Ancients immersed themselves in meditation,
they suffered some pains; having established powerful resolve,
they would traverse mountains and rivers to call on venerable
adepts. First Lung Ya met Ts'ui Wei and Lin Chi; later he called
on Te Shan. There he asked, "How is it when a student holding
a sharp sword tries to take the teacher's head?" Te Shan
stretched out his neck and uttered a grunt. Ya said, "The
teacher's head has fallen." Te Shan smiled slightly and let it go
at that.
Next Lung Ya went to Tung Shan. Tung Shan asked, "Where
did you come here from?" Ya said, "From Te Shan." Tung Shan
said, "What did Te Shan have to say?" Ya then recounted the

132

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

preceding story. Tung Shan asked, "What did he say?" Ya said,
"He had no words." Tung Shan said, "Don't say that he had no
words. Instead try to take Te Shan's fallen head and show it to
me." At this Ya had insight; thereupon he burned incense and
gazed far off towards Te Shan; he prostrated himself and re­
pented.
When he heard of this, Te Shan said, "Old man Tung Shan
can't tell good from bad; this fellow has been dead so long,
what's the use of saving him? Let him wander over the earth
carrying my head."
Lung Ya's basic nature was intelligent and acute. He went
foot travelling carrying a bellyfull of Ch'an. As soon as he got
to Ts'ui Wei in Ch'ang An he immediately asked, "What is the
meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West?" Wei said,
"Pass me the meditation brace," Ya took the meditation brace
and gave it to Wei. Wei took it and hit him. Ya said, "Since you
hit me I let you hit me; in essence, though, there is no meaning
of the Patriarch's coming from the West." He also asked Lin
Chi, "What is the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West?" Lin Chi said, "Pass me the cushion." Ya took the cush­
ion and gave it to Lin Chi; Chi took it and hit him. Ya said,
"Since you hit me I let you hit me; in essence, though, there is
no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West."
When Lung Ya posed the question, he not only wanted to see
the old fellows up on the carved wood seats, he also wanted to
illumine the great concern of his own self. We can say that his
words were not spoken in vain, that his effort was not ex­
pended haphazardly; they issued from his doing his work.
Haven't you heard? Wu Hsieh went to see Shih T'ou. He had
made an agreement with himself beforehand saying, "If there's
accord at the first word I'll stay; otherwise, I'll go." Shih T'ou
just sat on his seat; Hsieh shook out his sleeves and went out.
Shih T'ou knew that Wu Wsieh was a vessel of the truth, so he
had extended his teaching to him. But Hsieh hadn't understood
his meaning; he had announced his departure and gone out.
When he got to the gate Shi T'ou called out to him, "Rever­
end!" When Hsieh looked back, Shih T'ou said, "From birth to
death it's only this; don't seek anymore for anything else by
turning your head and revolving your brain." At these words
Hsieh was greatly enlightened.
Also, Ma Ku came to Chang Ching carrying his ring-staff; he

Twentieth Case

133

walked three times around the meditation seat, shook his staff
once, and stood there upright. Ching said, "Right, right." He
also went to Nan Ch'uan; as before he walked three times
around the seat, shook his staff and stood there. Nan Ch'uan
said, "Wrong, wrong. This is what the power of the wind can
whirl around; in the end it decomposes." Ma Ku said, "Chang
Ching said right; why do you say wrong?" Nan Ch'uan said,
"Chang Ching was right; it is you who are wrong."b
Inevitably the Ancients had to take up and penetrate
through this one matter. People today, as soon as they are
questioned, have not made the slightest application of effort;
they're this way today, and they'll be this way tomorrow too: if
you just keep on like this, even into the endless future you will
never have a day of completion. You must arouse and purify
your spirit; only thus will you have some small share of reali­
zation.
Look at Lung Ya coming out with one question, saying,
"What is the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West?" Ts'ui Wei said, "Pass me the meditation brace." When
Ya gave it to him, he took it and immediately hit Ya. When Ya
picked up the meditation brace, how could he have not known
that Wei was going to hit him? And it won't do to say that Ya
didn't understand, for why then did he pass the meditation
brace to Wei? But tell me, at the moment he understood, how
should Ya have acted? He didn't go to the living water to func­
tion, but took himself into the dead water for his sustenance.
Acting as master throughout, he said, "Since you hit me I let
you hit me; in essence, though, there is no meaning of the
Patriarch's coming from the West."
Lung Ya also went to Hopeh to call on Lin Chi. He asked his
question as before. Lin Chi said, "Pass me the cushion."
When Ya gave it to him, he took it and immediately hit Ya. Ya
said, "Since you hit me I let you hit me; in essence, though,
there is no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West."
Tell me, these two venerable adepts were not of the same
lineage; why did their answers resemble each other, why was
their functioning of one kind? You must realize that the one
word, one phrase of the Ancients was not uttered at random.
Later when Lung Ya dwelt in a temple, a monk asked him,
"Teacher, at that time, when you saw the two worthies, did
you agree with them or not?" Ya said, "As far as agreement

134

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

goes, I agreed; but there is no meaning of the Patriarch's com­
ing from the West." There are thorns in the soft mud. To let go
for people is already falling into the secondary; this old fellow
(Lung Ya) held steady-he only acted as an adept in the Tung
succession.c To be a disciple of Te Shan or Lin Chi, he would
have had to realize that there is a living side besides. As for me,
I am not this way; I would have told the monk, "As far as
agreement is concerned, I don't agree; in essence, though, there
is no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West."
Haven't you heard how a monk asked Ta Mei, "What is the
meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West?" Mei said,
"The coming from the West has no meaning." Yen Kuan heard
of this and said, "One coffin, two dead men." Hsuan Sha heard
of this and said, "Yen Kuan is indeed an adept!" (To which)
Hsueh Tou said, "There are even three (dead men)." The monk
asked about the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West; though Ta Mei told him that the coming from the West
has no meaning, if you understand in this way, you fall into the
realm of unconcern. Therefore Te Shan (Yuan Mi) said, "You
must study the living word; don't study the dead word. If you
can understand at the living word, you will never forget it; if
you understand at the dead word, you won't even be able to
save yourself."
When Lung Ya spoke this way, he had undeniably done his
best. The Ancient Tung Shan said, "Continuity is very dif­
ficult." The other Ancients, Ts'ui Wei and Lin Chi, were not
acting at random with their one word, one phrase; before and
after mutually illuminating, with both temporal and true, with
both illumination and function, guest and host obvious, inter­
changing vertically and horizontally.
If you want to discern the inside story, since Lung Ya was
not ignorant of the vehicle of our sect, how could he have fallen
into second place? At the time when the two venerable adepts
asked for the meditation brace and cushion, Ya could not have
but known their intention. It was just that he wanted to make
use of that which was within his own breast. Although he was
right, nevertheless his use of it was too extreme. Since Lung Ya
asked this way, and the two old ones answered this way, why
then is there no meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the
West? When you get here you must know that there's some­
thing else extraordinary. Hsueh Tou picks it up to show
people:

Twentieth Case

135

VERSE

In Dragon Tusk Mountain the dragon bas no eyes;<�
**He's blind. He can fool other people all
right, (but not me.) This is washing a clod
of earth in the mud. Everyone on earth knows.*
When bas dead water ever displayed the ancient way?
**Should it suddenly come to life, nothing can
be done. He drags in everyone on earth so that
they can't get out.*
If you can't use the meditation brace and cushion,
**Who would you have say this? What do you want
to do with the meditation brace and cushion?
Didn't he hand them over to you, Reverend?*
You should just give them over to Mr. Lu.
**But they can't be given over. You
lacquer bucket, don't entertain such
views!*

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou settles the case according to the facts. Though he
versifies this way, tell me, where is his meaning? Where does
the dragon lack eyes? Where is he in dead water? At this point
you must have the power to transform before you realize. That
is why it is said, "In a clear pool there's no place for the blue
dragon to coil up." Has there ever been a fierce dragon in stag­
nant water? Haven't you heard it said, "Stagnant water cannot
conceal a dragon"? If it is a live dragon, it must go to where vast
swelling billows of foamy waves flood the heavens. This is to
say that Lung Ya went into the dead water and was hit by the
others. Yet he did say, "Since you hit me I let you hit mei in
essence, though, there is no meaning of the Patriarch's coming
from the West." This prompted Hsueh Tou to say, "When has
dead water ever displayed the ancient way?" Although this is
so, tell me, was Hsueh Tou upholding (Lung Ya), or was he
diminishing his dignity?
People often misunderstand and ask, "Why did Hsueh Tou
say, 'You should just give them over to Mr. Lu'?" They are far
from knowing that Lung Ya did indeed give them to the others.

136

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Whenever you visit masters to ask for instruction, you must
discriminate in the midst of the action; only then will you see
where those Ancients met.
"If you can't use the meditation brace and cushion." Ts'ui
Wei said, "Pass me the meditation brace," and Lung Ya gave it
to him; isn't this making a living within dead water? Clearly
Lung Ya has been given a fine steed; it's just that he doesn't
know how to ride it, that he is unable to make use of it.
"You should just give them over to Mr. Lu." People fre­
quently say that Mr. Lu is the Sixth Patriarch; this is wrong.
Hsueh Tou has called himself Mr. Lu previously in a verse
called "Anonymous Bequest"! saw its picture that year and loved Tung T'ing;e

In the waves, seventy-two peaks of blue.
Now, resting on high, I think back to what was
before,
To the picture, I've added Mr. Lu leaning against a
wall.
Hsueh Tou wanted to walk on Lung Ya's head, but he still
feared that people would misunderstand, so he made up an­
other verse to cut away people's doubtful interpretations.
Again he picks it up and says,

VERSE

Since this old fellow couldn't yet put an end to it, again he
makes a verse:
**Obviously. How many people could there be who
would knowt He knew himself that he had attained
only a half; luckily he has a final word. *
Once Mr. Lu has accepted them, why depend on themt
**Even if you search the whole world, such a

all he can't get out. *

**They block off your eyes, they block off your ears.

COMMENTARY

"Once Mr. Lu has accepted them, why depend on them?" What

is there to depend on? Here you must understand things di­
rectly this way; don't go on guarding a stump waiting for a
rabbit. Smash what's before your skull all at once, so that there
isn't the slightest bit of concern within your breast. Let go and
become clean and at ease. Then what more need is there for
something to rely on? Whether sitting (on the cushion) or lean­
ing (on the brace), it's not worth considering it the principle of
the Buddha Dharma. That is why Hsueh Tou said, "Sitting,

leaning-cease to take these to succeed to the lamp of the
Patriarchs." At once, Hsueh Tou has brought it up completely;

he has a place to turn around in, and at the end reveals this

scene where there's a bit of a nice place. He says, "It's worth
replying: the evening clouds, returning, have not yet come to­

gether." Tell me, where is Hsueh Tou's meaning? When the

evening clouds have returned and are about to join together but
have not yet done so, tell me, how is it then? "Distant moun­
tains without end, layer upon layer of blue." As before he's

gone into the ghost cave. When you get here, when gain and

loss, right and wrong, are cut off all at once, and you are clean

and at ease, only then do you amount to something. "Distant

mountains without end, layer upon layer of blue." Tell me, is
this Manjusri's realm? Is this Samantabhadra's realm? Is this
Avalokitesvara's realm? When you get here, tell me, whose
affair is this?

In Sung times some Lin Chi masters criticized the Ts'ao-Tung
masters for being too fond of quiescence, abiding in extinction,
absorbed by the vastness of the universe; the fifth rank of the
Ts'ao-Tung's five ranks was symbolized by a solid black circle,
which the Lin Chi masters often took to mean nirvana as extinc­
tion. Tenkei Denson sometimes remarked that Yuan Wu was not
thoroughly familiar with the devices of the Tung lineage, and did
not realize that there is a turning point, a pivot, in each rank. The
Lin Chi masters emphasized the experience of

wu

(satori), en­

lightenment or awakening, and its active expression; they were
foremost in the use of contemplation themes, upon which they
would focus with a force known as 'doubt' or 'great doubt'. The
tension of the doubt was used to rid the mind of wandering
thought, unify the attention, and break mental habit patterns; the
sudden dissolution of the 'mass of doubt' was sometimes brought
about by blows or shouts, by a gesture, a word or phrase. After
dying 'the great death' and entering the Path, one is supposed to
return to life, awake and free; but it is said that many do not
return, being absorbed by the peace of death, forsaking forever the
clamor of life. Lung Ya is being 'criticized' for not showing his
own initiative.
d.

This refers to Lung Ya; the name Lung Ya means dragon's tusk,
and is the name of the mountain on which the Ch'an master Chu
Tun lived. As is customary, he is usually referred to by the name
of the place where he lived.

e.

This refers to Tung T'ing mountain in Su Chou (Soochow),
Chekiang, eastern China, where Hsueh Tou lived at one time, on
Ts'ui Feng (Green Peak). Hsueh Tou added a little picture of him­
self to a painting of Tung T'ing; this poem is just cited to show
that 'Mr. Lu' refers to Hsueh Tau himself.

Chih Men's Lotus Flower, Lotus
Leaves

INTRODUCTORY INSTRUCTION

Setting up the banner of the Teaching, establishing the essen­
tial meaning-this is adding flowers to brocade. Strip off the
blinders, unload the saddle pack-this is the season of the great
peace. If you can discern the phrase outside of patterns, then
when one is raised you understand three. Otherwise, if you're
not yet this way, as before humbly listen to this treatment.

MAIN CASE

A monk asked Chih Men, "How is it when the lotus flower has

not yet emerged from the water?"1 Chih Men said, "A Lotus
flower."2
The monk said, "What about after it has emerged from the
water?"3 Men said, "Lotus leaves."4

NOTES

1.

The hook is on the doubt-free ground. Washing a lump of dirt in
the mud. How did he get this news?

2.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. He stumps everyone on
earth.

3.

Don't go inside the ghost cave to make a living. Again the monk
goes on this way.

4.

the River. Two heads, three faces. He kills everyone on earth with

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

As for dealing with people in accordance with their potentials,
Chih Men has attained a little. When it comes to cutting off
the myriad streams, he's a million miles away. But say, is this
flower before and after it emerges from the water the samt or
different? If you can see this way, I'll grant that you've had an
entry. Nevertheless, if you say it's the same, you confuse your
buddha-nature and becloud true thusness. If you say it's differ­
ent, mind and environment are not yet forgotten, and you de­
scend to travel the road of interpretation. When will you ever
cease?
Tell me, what is the ancient's meaning? In reality there
aren't so many concerns. That is why T'ou Tzu said, "Just
don't attach names and words, classification and phrasing. If
you have understood all things, naturally you won't be at­
tached to them. Then there is no multiplicity of gradations of
differences; you take in all things; but all things won't be able
to take you in. Fundamentally there is no gain or loss, no illu­
sions or dreams, no multiplicity of names. You should not
insist on setting up names for them. Can I fool all of you
people? Since all of you ask questions, therefore there are
words. If you didn't ask, what could you have me say that
would be right? All concerns are what you take up: none of it is
any of my business." An ancient said, "If you want to know the
meaning of the buddha nature, you must observe times and
seasons, causes and conditions."
Haven't you seen Yun Men cite this story: A monk asked
Ling Yun, "How was it before the Buddha appeared in the
world?" Ling Yun raised his whisk. The monk asked, "What
about after he appeared in the world?" Again Ling Yun raised
his whisk. Yun Men said, "The first time he hit, the second
time he missed." He also said, "Without speaking of appearing
and not appearing, where would there be the time of his ask­
ing?"
With one answer for one question the ancients accorded
with the time and season without a multitude of concerns. If
you pursue words and follow after phrases, there will never be
any connection. If in the midst of words you can penetrate
through words, if in the midst of meanings you can pass
through meanings,

if within a device you can penetrate

Twenty-first Case

141

th rough the device, and if you let go and let yourself be at ease,
only then will you see Chih Men's answer. a
Yun Men said, "From ancient times till today, it's just been
one thing. There is no right or wrong, no gain or loss, no born or
not born." When they got here the ancients laid down one
single path where there's an entrance and an exit. If it's a man
who hasn't yet understood, then he's pressing against a fence,
running his hands over a wall, b (like a ghost) haunting the
weeds and trees. If you make him let go, he still goes into the
wild vast desolation. If it is a man who has attained, then
twenty-four hours a day he won't depend on a single thing.
While he doesn't depend on a single thing, when he reveals one
device, one object, how will you search him out?
This monk asked, "How is it when the lotus flowers have
not yet emerged from the water?" Chih Men said, "A Lotus
flower." This then is just an answer that blocks the question,
nevertheless it's exceptional. All over it's called "upside-down
words." How so? Haven't you heard: Yen T'ou said, "I always
hope you would attain a little before you open your mouths."
Where the ancient one Chih Men revealed his mind, he was
already leaking and tarrying. Students these days don't wake
up to the ancient's meaning: they just go on talking theoreti­
cally of "emerged from the water" and "not yet emerged from
the water." What connection is there?
Haven't you heard: A monk asked Chih Men, "What is the
body of Wisdom?" Men said, "An oyster enclosing the bright
moon." The monk asked, "What is the functioning of Wis­
dom?" Men said, "A rabbit becomes pregnant." Look at him
responding like this: no one on earth can search out the stream
of his words.
If someone asked me, "How is it when the lotus flowers
have not yet emerged from the water?" I would just answer
him by saying, "The pillar and the lamp."c Tell me, is this the
same as the lotus flowers or different? If I were asked, "What
about after they've emerged from the water?" I would answer,
"The staff upholds the sun and moon, underfoot how muddy
and deep!" You tell me, is this right or wrong? And don't mis­
takenly stick by the zero point of a scale.
Hsueh Tou is extremely compassionate, breaking up
people's emotional interpretations, so he comes out with his
verse:

142

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
VERSE

Lotus flower, lotus leaves-he reports for you to know
**Grandmotherly kindness. A manifest public case. Its
pattern is already revealed.*
How can emerging from the water compare to .when it has not
yet emerged!
**Washing a lump of dirt in the mud. Dividing them is
alright, but you can't lump them together.*
North of the river, south of the river, ask Old Wang
**Where is the master! Why ask Old Master Wang!
You're just wearing out your straw sandals.*
Fox-doubt after fox-doubt
**I bury them in one hole. It's you who doubt. You won't
avoid feelings of doubt without respite. Having struck
I say, "Do you understand!"*

COMMENTARY

Originally Chih Men was from Chekiang. He made his way by
stages to Szechuan to call on Hsiang Lin. After he had pene­
trated (this affair under Hsiang Lin's guidance), he returned to
dwell at Chih Men in Sui Chou.
Hsueh Tau was Chih Men's true successor: he saw well
Chih Men's most hidden, most subtle point and says directly,
"Lotus flower, lotus leaves-he reports for you to know/How
can emerging from the water compare to when it has not yet
emerged?" Here he wants people to understand directly and
immediately.
I say, "How is it when they've not yet emerged from the
water? The pillar and lamp. What about after they've emerged?
The staff upholds the sun and moon, underfoot how muddy
and deep!" But don't mistakenly abide by this as the zero point
of a scale. What limit is there to people these days chewing
over the words and phrases of others?
But tell me, when they emerge from the water, what time
and season is this? When they've not yet emerged from the
water, what time and season is this? If you can see to this
point, I'll allow that you've seen Chih Men personally.

Twenty-first Case

143

Hsueh Tou says, if you don't see, "North of the river, south
of the river, ask Old Wang." Hsueh Tou means that you should
just go north of the river and south of the river to ask the
venerable adepts about "emerged from the water" and "not
emerged from the water." If you add two phrases south of the
river, add two phrases north of the river, add one load upon
another load, creating doubts over and over, just tell me, when
will you get so that you don't doubt? You're like wild foxes,
full of doubt, walking on river ice: they listen for the sound of
the water (below); if it doesn't make a sound, then they can
cross the river. If students have "fox-doubt after fox-doubt,"
when will they attain peace and tranquility?

TWENTY-SECOND CASE

Hsueh Feng's Turtle-Nosed Snake

POINTER

There's nothing outside the great vastness; it's as fine as
atomic dust. Holding on and letting go are not another's (do­
ing): rolling up and rolling out3 rest with oneself. If you want to
free what is stuck and loosen what is bound, you simply must
cut away the traces (of thought) and swallow the sounds (of
words). All people occupy the essential crossing place; each
and every one towers up like a thousand fathom wall. But tell
me, whose realm is this? To test, I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

Hsueh Feng taught the assembly saying, "On South Mountain
there's a turtle-nosed snake.1 All of you people must take a
good look."2
Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "In the hall today there certainly are
people who are losing their bodies and their lives."3
A monk related this to Hsuan Sha. 4 Hsuan Sha said, "It
takes Elder Brother Leng (Ch'ang Ch'ing) to be like this.
Nevertheless, I am not this way."5 The monk asked, "What
about you, Teacher?"6 Hsuan Sha said, "Why make use of
'South Mountain'?"7
Yun Men took his staff and threw it down in front of Hsueh
Feng, making a gesture of fright.8

NOTES

this wild fox spirit has attained a little. He's lost his body and his

Why be afraid of it? One son has intimately attained. All of them
are giving play to their spirits. All of you try to discern this.

COMMENTARY

If you spread it out evenly, I let you spread it out evenly; if you
break it up, I let you break it up.
Hsueh Feng travelled with Yen T'ou and Ch'in Shan. In all,
he went to Mt. T'ou Tzu three times, and climbed Mt. Tung
nine times. Later he called on Te Shan, and only then did he
smash the lacquer bucket.
One day he went along with Yen T'ou to visit Ch'in Shan.
They got as far as an inn on Tortoise Mountain (in Hunan)
when they were snowed in. Day after day Yen T'ou just slept,
while Hsueh Feng constantly sat in meditation. Yen T'ou
yelled at him and said, "Get some sleep! Every day you're on
the meditation seat, exactly like a clay image. Another time,
another day, you'll fool the sons and daughters of other peo­
ple's families." Feng pointed to his breast and said, "I am not
yet at peace here; I don't dare deceive myself." T'ou said, "I had
thought that later on you would go to the summit of a solitary
peak, build a hut of straw, and propagate the great teaching: but
you're still making such a statement as this." Feng said, "I am
really not yet at peace." T'ou said, "If you're really like this,
bring forth your views one by one; where they're correct I'll
approve them for you, and where they're wrong I'll prune them
away for you."
Then Hsueh Feng related, "When I saw Yen Kuan up in the

146

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

hall bringing up the meaning of form and void, I gained an
entry." Yen T'ou said, "Henceforth for thirty years avoid men­
tioning this." Again Feng said, "When I saw Tung Shan's verse
on crossing the river, b I had an insight." T'ou said, "This way,
you won't be able to save yourself." Feng went on, "Later when
I got to Te Shan I asked, 'Do I have a part in the affair of the
vehicle of the most ancient sect, or not?' Shan struck me a
blow of his staff and said, 'What are you saying?' At that time it
was like the bottom of the bucket dropping out for me."
Thereupon Yen T'ou shouted and said, "Haven't you heard it
said that what comes in through the gate is not the family
jewels?" Feng said, "Then what should I do?" T'ou said, "In the
future, if you want to propagate the great teaching, let each
point flow out from your own breast, to come out and cover
heaven and earth for me." At these words Hsueh Feng was
greatly enlightened. Then he bowed, crying out again and
again, "Today on Tortoise Mountain I've finally achieved the
Way! Today on Tortoise Mountain I've finally achieved the
Way!"
Later Hsueh Feng returned to Min (Fukien) and lived on
Elephant Bone Mountain. He left behind this verse about him­
self:
Human life so hectic and hurried is but a brief in­
stant;
How can you dwell for long in the fleeting world?
As I reached thirty-two I emerged from the moun­
tains;
Already over forty, I return to Min.
No use bringing up the faults of others again and
again;
One's own mistakes must be cleared away con­
tinually.
I humbly report to the purple-clad nobles who fill

the court:
The King of Death has no awe of the golden
emblems of rank you wear.
Usually Hsueh Feng would go up into the hall and teach the
assembly by saying, "In every respect cover heaven and cover
earth." He talked no more of mystery or marvel, nor did he
speak of mind or nature. He appeared strikingly, alone, like a

Twenty-second Case

147

great fiery mass; approach and he burns off your face. Like the
T'ai Ya sword, fool around with him and you lose your body
and your life. If you linger in thought, holding back your activ­
ity, then you lose contact.
Pai Ching asked Huang Po, "Where are you coming from?"
Po said, "I've been at the foot of Mt. Ta Hsiung picking mush­
rooms." Chang said, "See any tigers?" Po then made a tiger's
roar. Then Chang picked up an axe and made a chopping mo­
tion; Po then slapped him. Chang chuckled and went back and
ascended his seat and told the assembly, "There's a tiger on Mt.
Ta Hsiung; all of you should watch out for him. Today I myself
was bitten by him."
Whenever Chao Chou saw a monk, right away he would say,
"Have you ever been here?" Whether the monk said he had or
he hadn't, Chou would always say, "Go drink some tea." The
temple overseer asked, "The teacher always asks monks if
they've been here or not, then always says, 'Go drink some tea.'
What is the meaning?" Chou said, "Overseer!" When the over­
seer responded, Chou said, "Go drink some tea."
Beneath the gate at Tzu Hu stood a signboard; the writing on
the plaque said, "At Tzu Hu there's a dog: on top he takes
people's heads, in the middle he takes people's midsections,
and below he takes people's legs; hesitate and you're lost." As
soon as he saw any newcomer, the Master of Tzu Hu would
immediately give a shout and say, "Look at the dog!" The
moment the monk turned his head, the master would return to
his abbot's room.
(These examples) are just like Hsueh Feng's saying, "On
South Mountain there is a turtle-nosed snake; all of you people
should watch it carefully." At just such a time, how would you
reply? Without following in your former tracks, try to say
something for me to see. When you get here, you must under­
stand the phrase outside of patterns; then, when all the public
cases are brought up, you will immediately know where they
come down. See how Hsueh Feng teaches the assembly this
way, without speaking to you of practice or understanding.
Can you figure him out by means of intellectual discrimina­
tion?
Since Ch'ang Ch'ing, Hsuan Sha, and Yun Men are sons of
his house, what they say is exactly appropriate. This is why the
Ancient said, "On hearing words, you must understand the

148

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

source; don't set up standards on your own." Words must have
that which is beyond patterns; phrases must penetrate the bar­
rier. If your words don't leave their nest of cliche, you fall into
the poison sea.
Hsueh Feng's teaching the assembly this way can be called
flavorless talk that blocks off people's mouths. Ch'ang Ch'ing
and Hsuan Sha are both men of his family, thus they under­
stand when he speaks this way.
What about "On South Mountain there's a turtle-nosed
snake"? Do all of you know what this really means? Here you
must be possessed of the all-pervasive eye in order to under­
stand. Haven't you seen Chen Ching's verse which says,
Beating the drum, strumming the lute,
Two men of understanding meet.
Yun Men is able to harmonizeCh'ang Ch'ing knows how to follow his vagaries;
The ancient song has no rhyme.
South Mountain's turtle-nosed snake;
Who knows this meaning?
Truly it's Hsuan Sha.

When Ch'ang Ch'ing replied as he did, tell me, what was his
meaning? To get here you must be like a stone-struck spark,
like a lightning flash; only then will you be able to reach. If
there's as much as a fine hair that you can't get rid of, then you
won't be able to reach his depths. It's a pity that people mostly
make intellectual interpretations of Ch'ang Ch'ing's words.
They say, "As soon as anything is heard in the hall, then this is
'losing body and life.' " Some say, "Fundamentally there's not
the slightest speck of anything; to say this kind of thing on
even blank ground makes people doubt. People hear him say,
'On South Mountain there's a turtle-nosed snake,' and im­
mediately they have doubts." If you understand in such ways,
you have no contact; you just go on making a living on the
words. If you don't understand this way, then how will you
understand?
Later a monk related this to Hsuan Sha. Hsuan Sha said, "It
takes Elder Brother Leng (Ch'ang Ch'ing) to be like this;
nevertheless, I am not thus." The monk asked, "What about
you, teacher?" Hsuan Sha said, "Why make use of 'South
Mountain'?" Just observe how within Hsuan Sha's words there

Twenty-second Case

149

is a place where he shows himself. Immediately he said, "Why
make use of 'South Mountain'?" If it hadn't been Hsuan Sha, it
would have been very difficult to reply. When Hsueh Feng
speaks this way, "On South Mountain there's a turtle-nosed
snake," tell me, where is it? To get here you must be a trans­
cendent person; only then will you be able to understand such
talk. The man of old Hsueh Tou said, "Up on the boat fishing,
the third son of the Hsieh doesn't like South Mountain; he
prefers the turtle-nosed snake."
Then again we get to Yun Men; he took his staff and threw it
down in front of Hsueh Feng, making a gesture of fright. Yun
Men has the ability to handle snakes, and doesn't run afoul of
the sharp point. He strikes home in light, and he strikes home
in darkness too. As he helps people it's always like doing a
sword dance; sometimes he flies onto people's eyebrows and
eyelashes, sometimes he flies three thousand miles away and
snatches people's heads. His throwing down his staff and mak­
ing a gesture of fright-isn't this giving play to his spirit?
Doesn't he lose his body and life too? Expert teaching masters
never go to a word or phrase to make a living. Just because he
likes the way Yun Men accorded perfectly with Hsueh Feng's
meaning, therefore Hsueh Tau makes his verse on it:

VERSE

Elephant Bone Cliff is so high no one goes there;
**A thousand, ten thousand, search but cannot
find. It's not your realm, sir.*
Those who get there must be master snake handlers.
**This is a spirit recognizing a spirit, a thief

Still, you must be of the same group to make it.

COMMENTARY

"Elephant Bone Cliff is so high that no one goes there; those
who get there must be master snake handlers." On Hsueh Feng
Mountain there is an Elephant Bone Cliff. Hsueh Feng's active
edge is lofty and steep; rarely is there anyone who reaches his
place. Hsueh Tou is a man of his house; they're birds of a
feather. Answering each other with the same voice, seeking
each other with the same spirit; it takes all-competent adepts
to join in the mutual witness of enlightenment.
Still, this turtle-nosed snake is unavoidably hard to handle;
you must know how to handle it before you can do so. Con­
versely, if you don't know how to handle it, you'll be bitten by
the snake. My late teacher Wu Tsu said, "With this turtle­
nosed snake, you must have the ability not to get your hands or
legs bitten. Hold him tight by the back of the neck with one
quick grab. Then you can join hands and walk along with me."
Ch'ang Ch'ing and Hsuan Sha had this kind of ability. When
Hsueh Tou says that Master Leng and Master Pei couldn't
handle it, people often say that Ch'ang Ch'ing and Hsuan Sha
couldn't do anything about it, and thus Hsueh Tou only praises
Yun Men. But this has nothing to do with it. How far they are
from knowing that among the three men there is no gain or
loss in ability; it's just that there is close and far away. Now I
ask all of you people, where is it that Master Leng and Master
Pei couldn't manage?
"How many lose their bodies and their lives?" This praises
Ch'ang Ch'ing's saying, "In the hall today there certainly are
people who lose their bodies and lives." To get here, first you
must be thoroughly versed in snake handling.
Hsueh Tou is descended from Yun Men, so he brushes the
others away all at once and just keeps one, Yun Men: Hsueh
Tou says, "Shao Yang knows; again he searches the weeds."
Since Yun Men knew the meaning of Hsueh Feng's saying, "On
South Mountain there's a

turtle-nosed

snake,"

therefore

"Again he searches through the weeds."
After Hsueh Tou has taken his verse this far, he still has
more marvels. He says, "South, north, east, west; no place to
search." You tell me where the snake is. "Suddenly he thrusts
out his staff." From the beginning the snake has been right

152

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

here. But you must not then go to the staff for sustenance. Yun
Men took his staff and threw it down in front of Hsueh Feng,
making a gesture of fright. Thus Yun Men used his staff as the
turtle-nosed snake. Once, though, he said, "The staff changed
into a dragon and has swallowed the universe; where are
mountains, rivers and the great earth to be found?" Just this
one staff-sometimes it's a dragon, sometimes it's a snake.
Why is it like this? Only when you get here will you know (the
meaning of the) ancient saying, "Mind revolves along with
myriad phenomena; the turning point is truly mysterious."
The verse says, "He throws it down before Hsueh Feng; it
opens wide its mouth. The gaping mouth is like a lightning
flash." Hsueh Tou has extra talent; he picks up Yun Men's
poisonous snake and says, "Just this gaping mouth is like a
flash of lightning." If you hesitate, then you lose your body and
life. "Raise your eyebrows (to look), and you won't see." Where
has it gone?
His verse finished, Hsueh Tou must go to a living place to
help others; he takes Hsueh Feng's snake and picks it up and
plays with it himself. Nothing can stop him from killing or
bringing to life in accordance with the occasion. Do you want
to see? He says, "Right now it's hidden here on Ju Peak." Ju
Peak is a name for Hsueh Tou Mountain.
Though Ch'ang Ch'ing, Hsuan Sha, and Yun Men can
handle the snake, they don't see. After all Hsueh Tou says,
"Right now it's hidden here on Ju Peak; those who come, one
by one observe expedient methods." Hsueh Tou is still too
subtle; he doesn't say, "Use it right away," but instead shouted
loudly and said, "Look right under your feet!" Since ancient
times how many people have picked up the snake and played
with it? Tell me, has the snake ever wounded anyone or not?
Then the Master Yuan Wu struck.

Pao Fu's Summit of the Mystic Peak

POINTER

Jewels are tested with fire, gold is tested with a stone; a sword
is tested with a hair, water is tested with a pole. In the school of
the patchrobed monks, in one word, one phrase, one act, one
state, one exit, one entry, one encounter, one response, you
must see whether someone is deep or shallow, you must see
whether he is facing forwards or backwards. But tell me, what
will you use to test him with? I bring this up: look!

Once when Pao Fu and Ch'ang Ch'ing were wandering in the
mountains,1 Pao Fu pointed with his hand and said, "Right
here is the summit of the mystic peak."2
Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "Indeed it is. What a pity!"3
Hsueh Tou added a word, saying, "Today what is the pur­
pose of travelling the mountains together with these fellows?"4
He also said, "Hundreds of thousands of years hence, I don't
say there are none, just that they will be few."5
Later this (dialogue between Pao Fu and Ch'ang Ch'ing) was
quoted to Ching Ch'ing. 6 Ching Ch'ing said, "If it hadn't been
Mr. Sun (Pao Fu), then you would have seen skulls covering the
fields."7

COMMENTARY

Pao Fu, Ch'ang Ch'ing, and Ching Ch'ing were all successors of
Hsueh Feng; these three men attained alike and realized alike,
saw alike and heard alike, picked up alike and used alike. With
one exit and one entrance, they pressed back and forth one after
the other. Since they were men born of the same lineage, as
soon as one raised something the others knew where it came
down. In Hsueh Feng's congregation it was just these three
who always engaged in questioning and answering. Whether
walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, the ancients were
mindful of this path; that is why as soon as it is brought up,
they know where it comes down.
One day when he was wandering in the mountains Pao Fu
pointed with his hand and said, "Right here is the summit of
the mystic peak." When Ch'an men these days are questioned
this way, then they only frown; fortunately it was Ch'ang
Ch'ing who was asked. Tell me, when Pao Fu spoke this way,
what was his purpose? When the ancient Pao Fu acted like this,
he wanted to test whether Ch'ang Ch'ing had eyes or not.
Ch'ang Ch'ing was a man of his house, so naturally he knew
what Pao Fu was getting at; thus he replied to him by saying,
"Indeed it is. What a pity!" But tell me, when Ch'ang Ch'ing
spoke this way, what was his meaning? You can't always go on
this way. Though there are those who seem so, (actually) there
is rarely anyone at ease without the slightest concern. Fortu­
nately Ch'ang Ch'ing understood Pao Fu completely.
Hsueh Tou added a word saying, "Today, travelling the
mountains with these fellows, what is the purpose?" Tell me,
where does this come down? Again he said, "Hundreds of
thousands of years hence, I don't say there are none, just that

156

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

they will be few." Hsueh Tau knows how to point to himself.
This is just like Huang Po's saying, "I don't say that there is no
Ch'an, just that there are no teachers." Hsueh Tau speaking
this way is also undeniably dangerous and steep. If Hsueh Tau
hadn't answered back with the same voice, how could it have
been this unique and marvelous? This is called an added com­
ment; it comes down on both sides, but though it comes down
on both sides, it doesn't remain on either side.
Later this was quoted to Ching Ch'ing. He said, "If it hadn't
been Mr. Sun, then you would have seen skulls covering the
fields." Sun is Ch'ang Ch'ing's lay surname. Haven't you heard
how a monk asked Chao Chou, "What is the lone summit of
the mystic peak?" Chou said, "I won't answer this question of
yours." The monk asked, "Why won't you answer this ques­
tion?" Chou said, "I fear that if I answered you, you would fall
onto the level ground."
In the teachings it says that the mendicant Meghasri always
stayed on the lone summit of the peak of wonder; he never
came down from the mountain. Sudhana went to call on him
and searched for seven days without encountering him. But
then one day they met on a separate peak. When he had seen
him, Meghasri explained for Sudhana that the three worlds are
a moment of thought and the wisdom and illumination of all
the Buddhas, the gate of Dharma that appears everywhere.
Given that Meghasri never came down from the mountain,
why then did they meet on a separate peak? If you say Meghasri
must have come down from the mountain, yet in the teachings
it says that he never did come down from the mountain, that
he was always on the solitary summit of the peak of wonder.
At this point, where are Meghasri and Sudhana really?
Later, Elder Li created some complications, and made up a
verse quite well:
The lone summit of the mystic peak
Is the teaching of one-flavor equanimity.
Each and every one-they're all real;
Each and every one-they're all complete.
Where there's no gain and no loss,
No affirmation and no negation,
There it stands alone revealed;
Therefore Sudhana couldn't see him.

Twenty-third Case

157

When you get to the point of merging with nature, it's like
"the eye does not see itself, the ear does not hear itself, the
finger does not feel itselfi it's like a sword doesn't cut itself, fire
does not burn itself." At this point there are many instances of
compassionate assistance in the teachingsi this is why they let
down a single path, and in methods of the secondary truth set
up host and guest, devices and objects, questions and answers.
Thus it is said, "The Buddhas have not appeared in the world,
nor is there any nirvana. They manifest such things as expe­
dient means to rescue sentient beings."
But tell me, in the end, how will you avoid Ching Ch'ing and
Hsueh Tou talking as they did? If they hadn't been able to clap
along in unison at that time, that would have been why "hu­
man skulls cover the fields all over the world." Ch'ang Ch'ing
comes up with this testimony, and both Pao Fu and Ch'ang
Ch'ing use it this way. Afterwards, Hsueh Tou comes out with
a verse even more brilliant. The verse says,

VERSE

On the lone summit of the mystic peak, weeds grow in profu­
sion;
*You lose your body too. (The weeds) are already sev­
eral fathoms deep beneath your feet. *

"On the lone summit of the mystic peak, weeds grow in profu­
sion." If you roll around in the weeds, when will you ever have
done? "Clearly it is brought up-to be given to whom?" Where
is the clarity? This praises Pao Fu saying, "Right here is the
summit of the mystic peak."
"If it hadn't been Mr. Sun discerning the real point." What
truth did Mr. Sun see that he could say, "So it is. What a pity!"?
As for "Skulls would cover the ground, but how many people
would know?" Do all you people know? Blind!

Kuei Shan and Iron Grindstone Liu

POINTER

Stand on the summit of the highest peak, and demons and
outsiders cannot know you; walk on the bottom of the deepest
sea, and even the Buddha's eye cannot catch sight of you. Even
if your eyes are like shooting stars and your intellect is like
flashing lightning, still you won't avoid (being like) the spirit
tortoise dragging his tail (leaving traces.) At this point, what is
proper? To test, I'm citing this: Look!

"Old cow, so you've come!"2

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

The nun 'Iron Grindstone' Liu was like a stone-struck spark,
like a lightening flash; hesitate and you lose your body and
your life. In the path of meditation, if you get to the most
essential place, where are there so many things? This meeting
of adepts is like seeing horns on the other side of a wall and
immediately knowing there's an ox, like seeing smoke on the
other side of a mountain and immediately knowing there's a
fire. When pushed they move, when pressed they turn about.
Kuei Shan said, "After I die, I'll go down the mountain to an
alms-giver's house and be a water buffalo. On my left flank five
words will be written, saying, 'A Kuei Shan monk, me.' At that
time, would it be right to call it a Kuei Shan monk, or would it
be right to call it a water buffalo?" When people these days are
questioned about this, they are stymied and can't explain.
Iron Grindstone Liu had studied for a long time; her active
edge was sharp

and

dangerous.

People called her

"Iron

Grindstone Liu." She built a hut a few miles from Kuei Moun­
tain. One day she went to call on Kuei Shan. When he saw her
coming, he said, "Old cow, so you've come." The Grindstone
said, "Tomorrow there's a great communal feast on Mt. T'ai;
are you going to go, Teacher?" Kuei Shan relaxed his body and
lay down, whereupon the Grindstone left. All of you look­
throughout they seemed to be conversing, but this is not
Ch'an, neither is it Tao. Can it be understood by calling it
unconcern?
Kuei Shan is over six hundred miles from Mt. T'ai; how then
did Iron Grindstone Liu want to have Kuei Shan go to the feast?
Tell me, what was her meaning? This old lady understands
Kuei Shan's conversation: fiber coming, thread going, one let­
ting go, one gathering in; they answer back to each other like
two mirrors reflecting each other, without any reflection image
to be seen. Action to action, they complement each other;
phrase to phrase, they accord.
People these days can be poked three times and not turn
their heads, but this old lady couldn't be fooled one little bit.
By no means is this an emotional view based on mundane
truth; like a bright mirror on its stand, like a bright jewel in the
palm of the hand, when a foreigner comes, a foreigner is re­
flected, and when a native comes a native is reflected. It's that

Twenty-fourth Case

161

she knows there is something transcendent; that's why she
acts like this.
Right now you are content to understand this as unconcern.
Master Yen of Wu Tsu said, "Don't take having concerns as not
having concerns; time and time again concern is born of un­
concern." If you can immerse yourself in this and penetrate
through, you will see that Kuei Shan and Iron Grindstone Liu
acting in this way is the same sort as ordinary people's conver­
sation. People are often hindered by the words, that's why they
don't understand. Only an intimate acquaintance can under­
stand them thoroughly.
It's like Ch'ien Feng teaching his assembly saying, "If you
raise one, you shouldn't raise two; let the first move go and you
fall into the secondary." Yun Men came forward and said,
"Yesterday there was a monk who came from T'ien T'ai and
returned to Nan Yueh." Ch'ien Feng said, "Chief cook, don't
participate in the general labor today."
Observe these two, Liu and Kuei Shan; when letting go, both
let go, and when gathering in, both gather in. In the Kuei-Yang
tradition, this is called "merging of perspectives."
In the wind-blown dust the grasses move; thoroughly com­
prehend the whole from the surface. This is also called "a
phrase which hinders one"-the meaning is conveyed but the
words obstruct. When you get here, you must be able to sweep
to the left and turn to the right; then you are an adept.

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tau's verses are universally considered the best of their
kind. Among the hundred verses this one verse is the most
logical, among them it is the most wondrously arrayed and
clearly set out.
"Once, riding an iron horse, she entered the fortress." This
praises Iron Grindstone Liu coming as she did to Kuei Shan.
"The edict comes down, reporting that the six nations are
cleared." This praises the way Kuei Shan questioned her. "Still
holding the golden whip, she questions the returning travel­
ler." This praises the Grindstone saying, "Tomorrow there's a
great communal feast on T'ai Shani are you going to go,
Teacher?" "In the depths of the night, who will go along to
walk the royal road?" This praises Kuei Shan relaxing his body
and the Iron Grindstone immediately leaving.
Hsueh Tau has this kind of ability: where they hurry he
praises their hurrying, and where they are easygoing he praises
their being easygoing. Feng Hsueh too once commented on this
case, and his meaning was the same as Hsueh Tou'si people all
over praise this verse:
Standing on the summit of the highest peak,
Unknown to demons and outsiders;
Walking on the bottom of the deepest sea,
Unseen even by Buddhas' eyes.
Look at Kuei Shan and Liu: one relaxed his body and lay
down, one immediately left. If you go on wandering around,
you won't ever be able to find the road. The meaning of Hsueh
Tau's verse is most excellent. If he didn't have the same at-

Twenty-fourth Case

163

tainment and the same realization, how could he be capable of
this? But say, what meaning was attained?
Haven't you heard how a monk asked Feng Hsueh, "When
Kuei Shan said, 'Old cow, so you've come!' what was his inner
meaning?" Feng Hsueh said, "In the depths of the white clouds
the golden dragon leaps." The monk asked,

"When Iron

Grindstone Liu said, 'Tomorrow there's a great communal
feast on T'ai Shan; are you going to go, Teacher?' what was her
inner meaning?" Hsueh said, "In the heart of the blue waves
the Jade Rabbit bolts." The monk asked, "When Kuei Shan
immediately lay down, what was his inner meaning?" Hsueh
said, "Old and worn-out, decrepit and lazy, days without con­
cern; lying idly deep in sleep, facing the blue mountains." This
meaning too is the same as Hsueh Tau's.

TWENTY-FIFTH CASE

The Hermit of Lotus Flower Peak
Holds up His Staff

POINTER

If your potential does not leave (its fixed) position, you tumble
down into the poison sea. If your words don't startle the crowd,
you fall into the streams of the commonplace.
Suddenly, if you can distinguish initiate from lay in the light
of sparks struck from stone, if you can decide between killing
and giving life in the light of a flash of lightning, then you can
cut off the ten directions and tower up like a thousand fathom
wall.
But do you know that such a time exists? To test I'm citing
this old case: look!

CASE

The hermit of Lotus Flower Peak held up his staff and showed
it to the assembly saying,1 "When the ancients got here, why
didn't they consent to stay here?"2
There was no answer from the assembly,3 so he himself
answered for them, "Because they did not gain strength on the
road."4
Again he said, "In the end, how is it?"5 And again he himself
answered in their place, "With my staff across my shoulder, I
pay no heed to people-! go straight into the myriad peaks."6

COMMENTARY

Can all of you judge the hermit of Lotus Flower Peak? His feet
still aren't touching the ground. Early in Sung times he built a
hut on T'ien T'ai's Lotus Flower Peak. After they had attained
the Path, the ancients would dwell in thatched huts or stone
grottos, boiling the roots of wild greens in broken legged pots,
passing the days. They didn't seek fame and fortune: uncon­
cerned, they accorded to conditions. They would impart a turn­
ing word, wanting to repay the benevolence of the buddhas and
patriarchs and transmit the Buddha Mind Seal.
As soon as he saw a monk coming, the hermit would hold up
his staff and say, "When the ancients got here, why didn't they
consent to stay here?" For more than twenty years, there was
never even one person who could answer. This one question
has both provisional and true, both illumination and function.
If you know his snare, it isn't worth taking hold of.
But tell me, why did he ask this question for twenty years?
Since this is the action of a master of the school, why did he
just keep to one peg? If you can see here, naturally you won't be
running in the dusts of the senses.
During the course of twenty years, there were quite a few
people who laid out their remarks to the hermit to present
their views, trying all their clever devices. Even if someone
could speak of it, still he did not reach the place of the hermit's
ultimate point. Moreover, although this matter is not in words
and phrases, if not for words and phrases, it could not be distin-

166

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

guished. Haven't you heard it said: "The Path is fundamentally
without words. We use words to reveal the Path"? Therefore
the essential point in testing others is to know them inti­
mately the minute they open their mouths.
The ancient man let down a word or half a phrase for no
other purpose than to see whether or not you know that 'this
matter exists.' He saw that the people did not understand; that
is why he himself answered for them, "Because they did not
gain strength on the road." See how what he says spontane­
ously accords with principles and meshes with the cir­
cumstances. When did he ever lose the essential meaning? The
ancient Shih T'ou said, "When you receive words you must
understand the source: don't set up standards on your own."
When people these days bump into it, they think that's
enough. Though they get to it, what can be done about their fat
headedness and confusion? When they come before an adept,
he uses the three essential seals a-sealing space, sealing water,
sealing mud-to test them. Then the adept sees whether the
square peg is stuck in the round hole with no way to come
down.
When the time comes where, will you search to look for one
here with the same attainment and realization? If it's a person
who knows that 'this matter exists,' then open your heart and
convey the message. What is there that can be wrong? If you
don't meet with such a person, then keep it to yourself for the
time being.
Now I ask all of you: the staff is something patchrobed
monks ordinarily use; why then does the hermit say that they
didn't gain strength on the road? Why does he say that when
the ancients got here, they didn't consent to stay here? In truth,
though gold dust is precious, when it falls into your eyes it
becomes a blinding obstruction.
Master Shan Tao of the Stone Grotto, when he was subject
to the persecution (of 845) would always take his staff and
show it to the assembly saying, "All the buddhas of the past are
thus, all the buddhas of the future are thus, all the buddhas of
the present are thus."
One day in front of the monk's hall Hsueh Feng held up his
staff and showed it to the crowd saying, "This one is just for
people of medium and low faculties." At the time there was a
monk who came forward and asked, "When you unexpectedly

Twenty-fifth Case

167

encounter someone of the highest potential, then what?" Feng
picked up his staff and left. Yun Men said, "I'm not like Hsueh
Feng when it comes to breaking up confusion." A monk asked,
"How would you do it, Teacher?" Yun Men immediately hit
him.
Whenever you study and ask questions, there aren't so many
things to be concerned with. (Concerns arise) because outside
you perceive that mountains and rivers and the great earth
exist; within you perceive that seeing, hearing, feeling, and
knowing exist; above you see that there are various buddhas
that can be sought; and below you see that there are sentient
beings who can be saved. You must simply spit them all out at
once: afterwards, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying
down, twenty-four hours a day, you fuse everything into one.
Then, though you're on the tip of a hair, it's as broad as the
universe; though you dwell in a boiling cauldron or in furnace
embers, it's like being in the land of peace and happiness;
though you dwell amidst gems and jewels in profusion, it's like
being in a thatched hut. For this kind of thing, if you are a
competent adept, you get to the one reality naturally, without
wasting any effort.
The hermit saw that no one could reach his depths, so again
he pressed them saying, "In the end, how is it?" Again they
couldn't deal with him. He himself said, "With my staff across
my shoulder, I pay no heed to people-! go straight into the
myriad peaks." Again, what is the meaning of this? Tell me,
what place is he pointing to as his whereabouts? Undeniably,
there are eyes in his words, but his meaning is outside the
words. He gets up by himself, he falls down by himself; he lets
go by himself, he gathers up by himself.
Haven't you heard: The venerable Yen Yang met a monk on
the road. He raised his staff and said, "What's this?" The monk
said, "I don't know." Yen Yang said, "You don't even recognize
a staff?" Again he took his staff and poked the ground saying,
"Do you recognize this?" The monk said, "No, I don't." Yen
Yang said, "You don't even recognize a hole in the ground?"
Again, he put his staff across his shoulder and said, "Do you
understand?" The monk said, "I don't understand." Yen Yang
said, "With my staff across my shoulder, I pay no heed to
people-! go straight into the myriad peaks." When the an­
cients got here, why didn't they agree to stay here?

Hsueh Tou has a verse which says:
I

Who,
Confronting the situation,

Old Lu doesn't know where he's goingTo go along together as before with white clouds

Why did I say, "If you see cheeks on the back of his head,
don't go along with him"? As soon as you make a comparative
judgment, you're in the demon cave of the mountain of dark­
ness making your living. If you can see all the way through and
your faith is thoroughgoing, then naturally a thousand or ten
thousand people won't be able to trap you or do anything about
you. When pushed or pressed, you will kill or give life spon­
taneously.
Hsueh Tou understood the hermit's meaning when he said,
"I go straight into the myriad peaks." At that point he begins to
make his verse. If you want to know where this is at, look at
Hsueh Tou's verse.

here?"

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou versifies very well: he has a place to turn around in
and doesn't stick to one corner. Immediately he says, "Dust
and sand in his eyes, dirt in his ears." This one line praises the
hermit of Lotus Flower Peak. When patchrobed monks get
here, they have nothing above to cling to or venerate, and
below they have no personal selves: at all times they are like
fools and dunces. Haven't you read of Nan Ch'uan saying,
"Among men of the Path, those that are like fools and dullards
are hard to come by." Ch'an Yueh's poem says, "I often recall
Nan Ch'uan's fine words/Such fools and dullards are indeed
rare." Fa Teng said, "What man knows the meaning of this? He
makes me think back to Nan Ch'uan." Nan Ch'uan also said,
"The seven hundred eminent monks (at the Fifth Patriarch's
place) were all men who understood the Buddhist Teachings.
There was only Workman Lu who didn't understand the Bud­
dhist Teachings. He just understood the Path: that's why he
obtained the Patriarch's robe and bowl." Tell me, how far apart
are the Buddhist Teachings and the Path?
Hsueh Tou brought up this saying of Nan Ch'uan's and said,
"Sand can't get in his eyes, and water can't get in his ears. If
there is a fellow whose faith is thoroughgoing and who can
hold fast, he isn't deceived by others. (For such a man) what a
bunch of meaningless noises are the verbal teachings of the
buddhas and patriarchs! So I invite you to hang up your bowl
and bag, break your travelling staff, and just become an uncon­
cerned man of the Path."
Hsueh Tou also said, "Mount Sumeru can be put in his eyes,
the waters of the great ocean can be put in his ears. There is a
kind of fellow who accepts people's haggling discussions and

170

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

the verbal teachings of the buddhas and patriarchs like a dragon
reaching the water, like a tiger taking to the mountains. He
must pick up his bowl and bag and put his staff across his
shoulder. He too is an unconcerned man of the Path."
Hsueh Tau also said, "Neither way will do; after all, there is
no connection."
Among the three unconcerned men of the Path (that Hsueh
Tau has described), if you would choose one man to be your
teacher, the correct choice is this kind of cast iron fellow.
Why? Whether he encounters environments of evil or of won­
ders, to him what he faces is all like a dream. He doesn't know
there are six senses, nor does he know there is sunrise and
sunset. Even if you get to this realm, you must not cling to the
cold ashes of a dead fire, you must not plunge into the flood of
darkness. You still must have a way to turn around before you
attain. Haven't you read of an ancient saying, "Don't cling to
the greenness of the strange plants on the cold cliff. If you cut
off the white clouds, the source is not marvellous."
Thus the hermit of Lotus Flower Peak said, "It's because
they didn't gain strength on the road." To get it you simply
must go into the myriad peaks. But say, what is being called
"the myriad peaks"?
Hsueh Tau just likes him saying, "With my staff across my
shoulder, I pay no heed to people-I go straight into the myriad
peaks." Therefore he comes out with the verse. But tell me,
where does he go? Is there anyone who knows where he goes?
"Falling flowers, flowing streams, very vast." Falling flowers
in profusion, flowing streams vast, endless. For the lightning
flash mind, what is before the eyes?
"Suddenly raising my eyebrows to look-where has he
gone?" Why doesn't Hsueh Tau know where he's gone either?
It's just like me raising my whisk just now: tell me, where is it
now? If all of you people can see, you're studying with the
hermit of Lotus Flower Peak. If not, go back to your places and
try to investigate and observe carefully.

Pai Chang's Sitting Alone on Ta
Hsiung Mountain

CASE

A monk asked Pai Chang, "What's the extraordinary affair?"1

Chang said, "Sitting alone on Ta Hsiung Mountain."2
The monk bowed;3 Chang thereupon hit him.4

NOTES

There's an echo in the words. He demonstrates his ability in a
phrase. He flabbergasts people. Though this monk has eyes, he's
never seen.

to see such things.
4.

Chang is a competent teacher of our school: why does he not
speak much? The imperative is not carried out vainly.

COMMENTARY

He has the eye to face situations and not heed danger or death.
Thus it is said, "How can you catch tiger cubs without entering
the tiger's lair?" Pai Chang was ordinarily like a tiger with
wings. Nor does this monk shun birth and death: he dares to
grab the tiger's whiskers and asks, "What's the extraordinary
affair?" This monk too has eyes. Pai Chang immediately took
up the burden with him saying, "Sitting alone on Ta Hsiung
Mountain." The monk then bowed. Patchrobed monks must
be able to discern the meaning before the question.

172

Twenty-sixth Case

173

This monk's bowing was not the same as ordinary bowing:
he had to have eyes before he could do this. He didn't spill all
his guts to others. Though they knew each other, they acted
like they didn't.
As for "A monk asked Pai Chang, 'What's the extraordinary
affair?' Chang said, 'Sitting alone on Ta Hsiung Mountain.' The
monk bowed; then Chang hit him": observe how when they let
go, they both do so at once, and when they gather back, they
wipe away the tracks and obliterate the traces. But say, when
the monk bowed right then, what was his meaning? If you say
it was good, then why and for what did Pai Chang then hit
him? If you say it was no good, what was wrong about his
bowing? When you get here, you must be able to tell right from
wrong, distinguish initiate from outsider, and stand on the
summits of a thousand peaks, to begin to understand.
This monk's bowing was like grabbing the tiger's whiskers:
he was just contending for a pivotal position. Fortunately
there's an eye on Pai Chang's forehead and a talisman behind
his elbow, shining through the four quarters and profoundly
discerning oncoming winds. Therefore he immediately hit the
monk. If it had been someone else, he wouldn't have been able
to handle the monk. The monk met mind with mind, conveyed
intention with intention: that is why he bowed.
Nan Ch'uan said, "Last night at midnight, Manjusri and
Samantabhadra came up with views of Buddha and Dharma. I
gave them each twenty blows and sentenced them to be
hemmed in by twin iron mountains." At the time Chao Chou
came forward and said, "Who should take your beating,
Teacher?" Nan Ch'uan said, "Where was my fault?" Chou
bowed.
Masters of our school do not idly observe how the other
takes action. The moment they are in charge of the situation
and bring it into play, they are naturally leaping with life.
My late teacher Wu Tsu would often say, "It's like coming
to grips in the front lines." I'm always telling you simply to cut
off seeing and hearing, form and sound, all at once-then you'll
be able to hold fast and act with mastery. Only then will you
see Pai Chang. But tell me, how about when letting go? Look at
Hsueh Tou's verse:

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou can see all the way through: thus he can come out
with the verse. The heavenly colt runs a thousand miles in a
day, runs back and forth and up and down, gallops as though
flying: thus he is called the heavenly colt. Hsueh Tou is prais­
ing Pai Chang-in the territory of the patriarchs he runs from
east to west and from west to east, a single coming, a single
going, free in all directions, totally without the slightest hin­
drance, just like the heavenly colt. He was well able to gallop:
only thus can we see how free he is. This is because he attained
Ma Tsu's great ability and great function.
Haven't you heard? A monk asked Ma Tsu, "What is the
great meaning of the Buddhist Teachings?" Tsu then hit him
and said, "If I didn't hit you, all the people in the world would
be laughing at me." Again, the monk asked, "What is the

Twenty-sixth Case

175

meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West?" Tsu said,
"Come here and I'll tell you." The monk approached and Tsu
boxed his ears saying, "Six listeners don't draw the same con­
clusions (as to what was said.)" Observe how Ma Tsu attained
the great independence in such fashion: within the gate of
expedients, sometimes he rolls out, sometimes he rolls up.
Sometimes the rolling out isn't in the rolling up, sometimes
the rolling up isn't in the rolling out. Sometimes rolling out
and rolling up both aren't there. Hence the saying, "On the
same path but not in the same groove."
Hsueh Tau says, "In a flash of lightning or sparks struck
from

stone

he

retains

the

ability

to

change

with

cir­

cumstances." This praises the monk for being like sparks
struck from stone, like the brilliance of a flash of lightning­
it's just a matter of a bit of changing with the situation. Yen
T'ou said, "Turning away from things is superior; pursuing
things is inferior. In battle each man occupies a pivotal posi­
tion." Hsueh Tau said, "The wheel of potential has never
turned. If it turns, it surely must go both ways." And if it can't
be turned, what's the use? Even powerful men must know a
little of changing with circumstances. People these days just
offer (their teacher) their true feelings and get their nostrils
pierced by him. What end will there be?
This monk was able in the midst of lightning flashes and
sparks to retain the ability to change with the situation, so he
bowed. Hsueh Tau says, "How laughable-a man comes to
grab the tiger's whiskers!" Pai Chang was like a tiger-how
laughable that this monk went to grab the tiger's whiskers.

TWENTY-SEVENTH CASE

Yun Men's The Body Exposed, The

Golden Wind

POINTER

Ask one, answer ten. Raise one, understand three. Seeing the
rabbit he looses the falcon-he uses the wind to fan the
flame-he doesn't spare his eyebrows.
This I leave aside for the moment. How is it when entering
the tiger's lair? To test I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

A monk asked Yun Men, "How is it when the tree withers and
the leaves fall?"1
Yun Men said, "Body exposed in the golden wind."2

NOTES

l.

What season is this? When the family breaks up, the people
perish; when the people perish, the family breaks up.

2.

He holds up the sky and supports the earth. He cuts nails and
shears through iron. Clean and naked, bare and purified. Walking
with even steps through the blue sky.

COMMENTARY

If you can comprehend here, then you begin to see where Yun
Men helped people. Otherwise, if you still can't, as before
you'll be pointing to a deer and calling it a horse: your eyes are
blind, your ears are deaf. Who arrives at this realm?
Tell me, do you think Yun Men answered the monk's ques­
tion, or do you think he was harmonizing with him? If you say

176

Twenty-seventh Case

177

he answered his question, you are wrongly sticking to the zero
point of a scale. If you say he harmonized with him, this has
nothing to do with it. Since it's not this way, ultimately, how
is it? If you can see all the way through, patchrobed monks'
nostrils are not worth a pinch. Otherwise, if you still can't, as
before you'll plunge into the ghost cave.
In general, to uphold and establish the vehicle of our sect,
you must take up the burden with your entire being and not
fear for your eyebrows, you must stretch out in the tiger's
mouth and allow others to pull you back and forth and drag you
down. If you're not like this, how will you be able to help
people?
This monk posed a question that was indeed dangerous and
lofty. If you look at him in ordinary terms, he just seems to be a
monk involved in idle concerns. If you go by the traditions of
patchrobed monks, when you go into his life line and look,
then he undeniably has something marvellous about him. But
say, when the tree withers and the leaves fall off, whose realm
is this? In Fen Yang's scheme of eighteen kinds of questions,
this is called "a question to test the host." It is also called "a
question that uses things."
Yun Men did not stir a hairsbreadth, but just said to him,
"Body exposed in the golden wind." He answered most won­
drously, and without presuming to turn his back on the monk's
question either. Since his question had eyes, Yun Men's an­
swer too was straight to the point. An ancient said, "If you
want to attain Intimacy, don't ask with a question." If you
really know someone, you know what he's getting at as soon as
he mentions it. If you go to the vein of Yun Men's words to
look, you've immediately gone wrong. It's just that in his
phrases Yun Men was often wont to provoke people's emo­
tional interpretations. If I made up emotional interpretations
to understand him, I wouldn't avoid being bereft of my succes­
sors.
Yun Men liked to ride the thief's horse to pursue the thief in
this way. Haven't you heard: a monk asked him, "What is that
which is not within reach of thought?" Men said, "Impossible
for cognition to fathom." This monk asked, "How is it when
the tree withers and the leaves fall?" Men said, "Body exposed
in the golden wind." In his words he unstoppably seizes and
cuts off the essential bridge and doesn't let ordinary or saintly

178

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

through. You must understand how Yun Men raises one and
illuminates three, raises three and illuminates one. If you go to
his three phrases to seek, then you're pulling an arrow out of
the back of your head. In a single phrase of Yun Men's, three
phrases are inevitably present: the phrase that contains heaven
and earth, the phrase that follows the waves and pursues the
currents, and the phrase that cuts off the myriad streams.
(What he says) is naturally exactly appropriate. But tell me, of
the three phrases, which one does Yun Men use to receive
people? Try to discern this.
The verse says:

VERSE

Since the question has the source,
**Hsueh Tau profoundly discerns the oncoming wind.
The arrow is not shot in vain.*
The answer too is in the same place.
**How could there be two? Yun Men is like a bell wait­
ing to be struck. His efforts are not expended exces­
sively.*
Three phrases should be distinguished:
**Above, between, below. Which phrase is his answer
here? First you must comprehend outside of the three
phrases.*
An arrowpoint flies far into the void.
**On target! It's gone by. Hitting, striking. The arrow
flies past Korea. *
Over the great plains-chilling windblasts howling, wailing,
**Throughout the heavens, all over the earth. Do you feel
your hairs standing on end? He's let go.*
In the eternal sky-intermittent misty rains.
**The winds are great, the waters vast. Above your
heads, boundless vastness; below your feet, boundless
vastness.*
Haven't you seen the traveller sitting so long at Shao Lin, who
hasn't returned?
**Here's another dunce. He's gotten others involved. The
Yellow River flows turbid from its source.*

Twenty-seventh Case

179

Tranquil up on Bear Ears Mountain, a single gathering.
**Open your eyes and you see, shut your eyes and you
see too. Making a living in the ghost cave. Your eyes
are blind, your ears are deaf. Who arrives at this
realm� You don't avoid smashing your gap-teeth.*

COMMENTARY

The ancient man Shih T'ou said, "When you receive words,
you must understand the source. Don't set up standards on
your own." The ancient man's words were not empty talk.
Hence it is said, "In general to ask about this affair you must
have some knowledge of right and wrong. If you don't know
noble from base behavior, if you can't recognize pure and de­
filed, if you let your mouth speak at random, what will be the
gain?"
Whenever one utters words and spews out breath, it must be
like clamps, like tongs, it must have hooks and chains, it must
have unbroken continuity. This monk's question had the
source meaning: Yun Men's answer was also this way. Yun
Men always taught people with three phrases (in one): this is
his ultimate pattern.
Hsueh Tau's verse on this case is similar in kind to his verse
on the (eighty-second) case, about Ta Lung. "Three phrases
should be distinguished." Three phrases are inevitably present
in each phrase of Yun Men's. If you can distinguish them, then
you penetrate beyond the three phrases. "An arrowpoint flies
far into the void." He shot it so far that you must set your eyes
on it quickly to catch sight of it. And if you can see it clearly,
you can open out the universe in a single phrase.
At this point the verse is completed, but Hsueh Tou has
extra talent so he opens out and says, "Over the great plains­
chilling windblasts howling, wailing/In the eternal sky­
intermittent misty rains." Tell me, is this mind or is this ob­
ject? Is this mysterious or is this wondrous? An ancient said,
"The truth of things is not hidden-from ancient times till
now it's always been obvious."
The monk asked, "What's it like when the tree withers and
the leaves fall?" Yun Men said, "Body exposed in the golden
wind." Hsueh Tau's intent was just to create a single environ­
ment. What's in front of your eyes right now, the whistling

180

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

wind, is either the southeast wind or the northwest wind. It
will be all right only if you understand Hsueh Tou's meaning
this way. If you go further and understand it as Ch'an or Tao,
this has nothing to do with it.
"Haven't you seen the traveller sitting so long at Shao Lin,
who hasn't returned?" Before he returned to the West Bod­
hidharma sat facing a wall for nine years, utterly silent. But
say, is this "the tree withers, the leaves fall"? Is this "body
exposed in the golden wind"? If here all past and present fools
and sages, sky, earth, and the great world are all fused into one,
then you will see how Yun Men and Hsueh Tou really helped
people.
"Tranquil up on Bear Ears Mountain, a single gathering."
Bear Ears Mountain is Shao Lin on Sung Shan near the Western
Capital. In front and behind, the mountains are clustered
thickly by the thousands. Where will all of you people see? Do
you see where Hsueh Tou helps people? Even if you do, this is
still the spirit tortoise dragging his tail (leaving traces).

TWENTY-EIGHTH CASE

Nan Ch'uan's Truth That's Never
Been Spoken

CASE

Nan Ch'uan went to see Master Nirvana of Pai Chang (Moun­
tain.)
Chang asked, "Have all the sages since antiquity had a truth
that they haven't spoken for people?"1
Ch'uan said, "They have."2
Chang said, "What is the truth that hasn't been spoken for
people?"3
Ch'uan said, "It's not mind, it's not buddha, it's not any
thing."4
Chang said, "You said it."5
Ch'uan said, "I am just thus. What about you, Teacher?"6
Chang said, "I am not a great man of knowledge either: how
would I know whether it has been spoken or not?"7
Ch'uan said, "I don't understand."8
Chang said, "I've already spoken too much for you."9

NOTES

l.

A master should know. It stands like a wall ten thousand fathoms
high. Does Chang feel his teeth falling out?

2.

He's fallen into the weeds. Why so brash? Then there is such a
thing!

Look how his hands are flustered, his feet frantic. He adds error to
error. Just try and ask!

Chang shouldn't speak this way to him.

long; with the short, he's short. When the reasoning is superior,
he goes to it.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Look how his hands are flustered, his feet frantic. He hides his
body but reveals his shadow. He acts totally dead. There are
thorns in the soft mud. Though he acts like this, how could he
swindle me?

8.

He can only act this way. Luckily he doesn't understand. If you
understand I'll immediately break your head open! Fortunately
this fellow is just this way.

9.

Adding frost on top of snow. Why the dragon's head and snake's
tail?

COMMENTARY

At this point he doesn't use "it's mind" or "it's not mind," nor
does he use "not mind" or "not not mind." Even though from
head to foot he doesn't have one hair of his eyebrows, still, he's
gotten somewhere. Meditation Master Shou calls "it's mind" a
revealing-explanation and "it's not mind" a concealing­
explanation.
This Master Nirvana is Meditation Master Fa Cheng. For­
merly he dwelled as retired abbot in the western hall at Pai
Chang: (he had the monks) clear fields for him and (in return)
he preached the great meaning for them.
At this time Nan Ch'uan had already seen Ma Tsu, but he
was going around to various places to settle (what's right) and
pick out (what's wrong.)
When Pai Chang posed this question it was indeed very dif­
ficult to respond to. He said, "Have all the sages since antiquity
had a truth that they haven't spoken for people?" If it had been
me, I would have covered my ears and left. Look at this old
fellow's scene of embarrassment. If an adept had seen him ask­
ing this way, he would have been able to see through him
immediately. But Nan Ch'uan just went by what he had seen,
so he said, "They have." This was indeed brash.
Pai Chang then added error to error and followed up behind
saying, "What is the truth that hasn't been spoken for people?"
Ch'uan said, "It's not mind, it's not buddha, it's not any thing."
Greedily gazing at the moon in the sky, this fellow has lost the
pearl in the palm of his hand. Chang said, "You said it." Too
bad-he explained in full for Nan Ch'uan. At the time I would

Twenty-eighth Case

183

have simply brought my staff down across his back to get him
to know real pain.
Although it was like this, you tell me, where did he say it?
According to Nan Ch'uan's view, it's not mind, it's not
buddha, it's not any thing, it's never been spoken. So I ask all of
you, why did Pai Chang nevertheless say, "You said it"? And
there aren't any tracks or traces in Nan Ch'uan's words. If you
say he didn't say it, then why did Pai Chang talk like this?
Nan Ch'uan was a man who could shift and get through, so
after this he pressed Pai Chang and said, "I am just thus. What
about you, Teacher?" If it had been anyone else, he wouldn't
have been able to explain. But Pai Chang was an adept: his
answer is undeniably extraordinary. Immediately he said, "I
am not a great man of knowledge either: how would I know
whether it has been spoken or not?" Nan Ch'uan then said his
"I don't understand." He said "I don't understand" while actu­
ally he did understand: this is not genuine not understanding.
Pai Chang said, "I've already spoken too much for you." But
tell me, where did he speak?
If they had been two fellows playing with mud balls, both
would have been covered with slime. If both were adepts, they
were like bright mirrors in their stands. In fact in the beginning
both were adepts; in the end they both let go. If you're a fellow
with eyes, you'll judge them clearly. But say, how will you
judge them?
Look at Hsueh Tau's verse:

VERSE

Patriarchs and Buddhas never helped people.
**Each guards his own territory. If you have standards,
hang onto standards. If you keep even a single word in
your mind, you go to hell fast as an arrow.*
Patchrobed monks present and past running neck and neck.
**Having worn out your straw sandals, break your staff
and hang up your bowl and bag. *
When the bright mirrors are on their stands, the range of im­
ages differs.

184

**They've fallen, they've broken. Come smash the mir­

One by one they all face south and see the northern dipper.
**Do you see me astride the buddha hall going out

to the hall; in China they haven't yet beaten the

The dipper handle is hanging down.
**You still don't know where it comes down. Where is

There's no place to seek.
**Blind men! Too bad! The cup falls to the ground, the
plate shatters to pieces.*
When you pick up your nostrils, you lose your mouth.
**Where did you get news of this� After all, it's so, so I
strike!*

COMMENTARY

Old Shakyamuni appeared in the world and in forty-nine years
never said a single word. Beginning from the Land of Brilliance,
ending at the river Hiranyavati, and for all the time in between,
he never spoke a single word. Tell me, was such talk speaking
or not? Right now it fills the Dragon Palace and fills the
Oceanic

Treasurehouse-how can this not

be

speaking?

Haven't you heard Lord of the Mountain Hsiu say:

The buddhas have not appeared in the world:
Forty-nine years of talk.
Bodhidharma didn't come from the West:
Shao Lin has a wondrous secret.
Again it's said:

The buddhas have not appeared in the world,
Nor is there any truth to be given to people.
They just were able to observe the hearts of living
beings,
Responding to their ills according to circumstances,
Giving medicines and dispensing prescriptions.

Twenty-eighth Case

185

Thus we have the twelve part teaching of the Triple
Vehicle.

In fact from ancient times till now, the patriarchs and bud­
dhas have never spoken for people. This very not helping
people deserves thoroughgoing investigation. I always say,
though I were to add a phrase as sweet as honey, when properly
viewed it's just poison. If you bring down your staff across their
backs and strike as soon as they blurt something out and push
them away, only then are you helping people on an intimate
level.
"Patchrobed monks present and past running neck and
neck." Everywhere they go they ask questions about is and is
not, about buddhas and patriarchs, about facing upwards and
facing down. Though they act like this, if they haven't arrived
at this realm, they can't do without this questioning.
"When the bright mirrors are on their stands, the range of
images differs." With just this one line you can distinguish
clearly. An ancient said, "The myriad forms are all the impres­
sion of the single truth." Again it's said, "The myriad forms are
all perfect within this." The great teacher Shen Hsiu said:
The body is the tree of enlightenment,
The mind is like a bright mirror.
Constantly take care to wipe it clean:
Don't let it be defiled with dirt and dust.

(The Fifth Patriarch) said that Shen Hsiu was still outside the
gate." When Hsueh Tou talks this way, tell me, is he inside or
outside the gate?
You people, each of you has an ancient mirror. All the
myriad forms-long, short, square, round-each and every one
appears in it. If you go to the longness or shortness to under­
stand, in the end you'll never be able to find it. This is why
Hsueh Tou said, "When the bright mirrors are on their stands,
the range of images differs."
Instead you must "All face south and see the northern dip­
per." When you're facing south why are you nevertheless to
look at the northern dipper? You'll see where Pai Chang and
Nan Ch'uan met only if you can understand this way. These
two lines (the third and fourth of the verse) praise Pai Chang
pressing and pressing again. Chang said, "I am not a great man

186

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

of knowledge either: how would I know whether it has been
spoken or not?"
At this point Hsueh Tau's verse has come down into dead
water. Fearing people would misunderstand he turned around
and picked it up himself, saying, "The dipper handle is hanging
down right now before your eyes: where else will you go to
look for it? As soon as you pick up your nostrils you lose your
mouth." Hsueh Tou has picked up the nostrils and lost the
mouth.b

TRANSLATOR S NOTES

a.

The Fifth Patriarch Hung Jen asked the members of his congrega­
tion to submit verses demonstrating their attainment, so that he
could choose his successor and pass on the robe and bowl. Of the
more than seven hundred disciples, none felt he could outdo Shen
Hsiu, who was considered the foremost among them: thus only
Shen Hsiu offered a verse. The Fifth Patriarch praised his verse
and had it written on a wall for the congregation to learn and
recite. Hui Neng, an illiterate workman in the congregation, hap­
pened to hear Shen Hsiu's verse being recited: knowing that
Shen's verse reflected a lack of true understanding, he had a boy
write another verse on the wall:

Fundamentally enlightenment is not a tree,
Nor is the mind-mirror a mirror.
From the beginning there hasn't been a single thing­
What's the use of wiping away dusU
When the Fifth Patriarch saw this, he made as if to disapprove, so
that the monks of his congregation would not become jealous of
Hui Neng, a layman and a barbarian. He came secretly to Hui
Neng and handed on the robe and bowl to him, sealing him as
the Sixth Patriarch.

Ta Sui's It Goes Along with It

POINTER

When fish swim through, the water is muddied; when birds fly
by, feathers drop down. He clearly discriminates host and
guest, he penetratingly distinguishes initiate and outsider, just
like a bright mirror in its stand, like bright pearl in the palm of
the hand. When a native comes, a native is reflected; when a
foreigner comes, a foreigner is reflected. The sound is obvi­
ous, the form is evident. But say, why is it like this? As a test
I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

A monk asked Ta Sui, "The conflagration at the end of the eon
sweeps through and the universe is totally destroyed. I wonder,
is this one destroyed or not?"1

doesn't go along with that, then what? I'll hit!

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

Master Fa Chen of Ta Sui was a successor of Meditation Master
Ta An. He was from Yen T'ing county in Tung Ch'uan (in
Szechuan). He called on more than sixty men of knowledge.
Formerly he was the keeper of the fire in Kuei Shan's con­
gregation. One day Kuei Shan asked him, "You have been here
several years, yet you still don't know how to pose a question,
so I can see what's what with you." Sui said, "What questions
would you have me ask to be right?" Kuei Shan said, "Since
you don't understand, ask, 'What is buddha?' " Sui covered
Kuei Shan's mouth with his hand. Shan said, "Later you will
not even find anyone to sweep the ground."
Later Ta Sui returned to Tung Ch'uan. At first he stayed by
the road on P'eng K'ou Mountain, making tea and waiting on
travellers for about three years in all. Only later did he finally
appear in the world and open a mountain monastery, dwelling
at Ta Sui.
There was a monk who asked him, "The conflagration at the
end of the eon sweeps through and the universe is totally de­
stroyed. I wonder, is this one destroyed or not?" This monk
just came up with a question based on an idea in the Teachings.
In the Teachings it says, "Formation, abiding, destruction,
emptiness. a When the age of the triple cataclysm occurs, the
destruction reaches to the third meditation heaven." Basically
this monk did not know the meaning of this statement.
Tell me, what is "this one"? People often make emotional
interpretations and say, "'This one' is the fundamental nature
of sentient beings." Sui said, "It is destroyed." The monk said,
"If so, then this goes along with it." Sui said, "It goes along
with it." As for "this one," so many people make emotional
interpretations and are unable to find it. If you say that it goes
along with it, where is it? If you say it doesn't go along with it,
then what? Haven't you heard it said: "If you want to attain
Intimacy, don't ask with questions"?
Later there was a monk who asked Master of the Mountain
Hsiu, "The conflagration at the end of the eon sweeps through
and the universe is totally destroyed. I wonder, is this one
destroyed or not?" The Master of the Mountain said, "It's not
destroyed." The monk said, "Why isn't it destroyed?" The
Master said, "Because it's the same as the universe." Both "it's
destroyed" and "it's not destroyed" obstruct people fatally.

Twenty-ninth Case

189

Since the monk didn't understand what Ta Sui said, he in­
evitably had this matter on his mind. He took this question
straight to Mt. T'ou Tzu in Shu Chou. T'ou Tzu asked him,
"Where did you come here from?" The monk said, "From Ta
Sui in western Szechuan." T'ou Tzu said, "What did Ta Sui
have to say?" The monk then recounted the former conversa­
tion. T'ou Tzu burned incense and bowed and said, "In western
Szechuan there's an ancient buddha who has appeared in the
world. As for you, hurry back to him!" The monk returned to
Ta Sui but Sui had already passed on. What an embarrassment
for this monk!
Later there was a monk at the T'ang court named Ching
Tsun who said of Ta Sui:

Clearly there is no other truthWho says (the Fifth Patriarch) approved the south­
erner Neng�
The one phrase "it goes along with it"
Makes a patchrobed monk run over a thousand
mountains.
A cricket who's cold cries in the piled up leaves;

By night a ghost bows to the lamp before a crypt.
The humming stops outside the lonely window,
He wanders back and forth, unable to overcome his
regret.
Hence Hsueh Tou draws on two of these lines afterwards to
make his verse.
Ri ght now, you shouldn't make the understanding that it is
destroyed, and you shouldn't make the understanding that it is
not destroyed. In the end, how will you understand? Quick, set
your eyes on it and look!

VERSE

In the light of the conflagration ending the age he poses his
question**What is he saying� He's already gone wrong.*
The patchrobed monk is still lingering within the double bar­
rier.
**If you squash this man how can he be saved� A
hundred layers, a thousand levels.*

190

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

How touching-for a single phrase, "going along with that,"
**The world's patchrobed monks all make this sort of
judgment. It's not even worth it for a thousand
phrases, for ten thousand phrases. What's hard about
cutting off his footsteps?*
Intently he travelled out and back alone for ten thousand
miles.
**His active consciousness is very chaotic. He stumbled
by without knowing it. He's just wearing out his
straw sandals.

*

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou takes charge of the situation and comes out with
his verse: in his words there's a place where he shows himself.
"In the light of the conflagration ending the age he poses his
question/The patchrobed monk is still lingering within the
double barrier." From the first this monk's question was con­
cerned with "it is destroyed" and "it is not destroyed"-this is
the double barrier. A person who has attained has a place to
show himself whether he is told "it is destroyed" or he is told
"it is not destroyed."
"How touching-for a single phrase, 'going along with
that,'/Intently he travelled out and back alone for ten thousand
miles." This versifies this monk taking the question to T'ou
Tzu, then returning again to Ta Sui-this can indeed be called
being intent for ten thousand miles.

Chao Chou's Big Turnips

A monk asked Chao Chou, "Teacher, I have heard that you
have personally seen Nan Ch'uan. Is this true or not?"1
Chou said, "Chen Chou produces big turnips."2

NOTES

him. Everyone has a pair of eyebrows.
He holds up the sky and supports the earth. He cuts nails and
shears through iron. The arrow flies past Korea.
A

COMMENTARY

This monk too is one who has studied for a long time: inevita­
bly, there's an eye in his question. Nevertheless, Chao Chou is
an adept: he immediately says to him, "Chen Chou produces
big turnips." This can be called flavorless talk that blocks off
people's mouths. This old fellow Chao Chou greatly resembles
a thief who steals in broad daylight. As soon as you open your
mouth he immediately plucks your eyes out.
If you are an exceptional brave-spirited fellow, then amidst
sparks struck from stone and the brilliance of a lightning flash,
as soon as you hear it raised, you immediately get up and go.
Otherwise, if you linger in thought and hold back your poten­
tial, you won't avoid losing your body and your life.
In judging this case the wild sage Ch'eng of Kiangsi called it
"asking about the east, answering about the west." He said
that Chao Chou didn't answer and didn't climb into his trap. If
you understand this way, how will you get it?
Jurist Yuan said, "These are words (affording) a glimpse from
the side." This is contained in the Nine Belts. If you under191

192

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

stand this way, you haven't even seen it in dreams, and,
moreover, you're dragging Chao Chou down.
Some say, "Chen Chou has always produced big turnips, as
everyone in the country knows. Chao Chou had called on Nan
Ch'uan: everyone in the country knows this. That's why, when
this monk nevertheless still asked whether or not Chao Chou
had personally seen Nan Ch'uan, Chao Chou said to him,
'Chen Chou produces big turnips.'" But this has nothing to do
with it.
If you don't understand in any of these ways, in the end, how
will you understand? Chao Chou has his own road through the
skies.
Haven't you heard: A monk asked Chiu Feng, "Teacher, I
have heard that you personally saw Yen Shou. Is this true or
not?" Feng said, "Is the wheat in front of the mountain ripe yet
or not?" This matches exactly what Chao Chou said to the
monk: both are like iron hammer heads with no handle holes.
Old man Chao Chou is an unconcerned man. If you question
him carelessly he immediately snatches your eyes out. If
you're a man who knows what is, you'll chew it carefully and
swallow it. If you're a man who doesn't know what is, it will be
like swallowing a date whole.

VERSE

Chen Chou produces big turnips**Everyone knows. Just avoid saying so. Each time it's
brought up it's brand new.*
All the patchrobed monks in the country seize upon this as a
principle;

COMMENTARY

"Chen Chou produces big turnips." If you seize upon this as
the ultimate principle, you've already gone wrong. When the
ancients joined hands and ascended high mountains, they
couldn't avoid the laughter of onlookers. People all know that
this answer of Chao Chou's is a statement of the ultimate
principle, though in the end they don't know where the ulti­
mate principle is. That's why Hsueh Tou says, "All the patch­
robed monks in the country seize upon this as a principle/They
only know it as extending from past to present/How can they
discern that the swan is white and the crow is black?"
Though they know that both ancient people and modern
people have answered this way, when have they ever been able
to distinguish expert from naive? Hsueh Tou says, "To really
understand you must discern the swan's whiteness and the
craw's blackness within the sparks Chao Chou strikes from
stone, within the brilliance of Chao Chou's lightning flash."
At this point the verse on this case is completed, but Hsueh
Tou brings out his own opinion and goes to the place leaping
with life to tell you more: "Thief! Thief!/He has snatched
patchrobed monks' nostrils." All the buddhas of past, present,
and future are thieves too; the successive generations of pat­
riarchs are thieves too. They were well able to snatch away
people's eyes. As for the skill not to blunder, I only approve
Chao Chou. But tell me, how does he make a good thief?
"Chen Chou produces big turnips."

Ma Ku Carrying his Ring-Staff

Move, and a shadow appears; become aware, and ice forms. Yet
if you don't move and are not aware, you will not avoid enter­

water, like a tiger taking to the mountains. Let go, and even
tiles and pebbles emit light; hold still, and even real gold loses
its color.
The ancients' public cases could not avoid being round­
about, but tell me, what were they discussing? To test, I cite
this. Look!

Ma Ku, carrying his ring-staff, a went to Chang Ching. He cir­
cled the meditation seat three times, then shook his staff once
and stood there upright.1 Chang Ching said, "Correct. Cor­

Ma Ku also went to Nan Ch'uan: he circled the meditation
seat three times, shook his staff once and stood there upright. 4
Nan Ch'uan said, "Incorrect. Incorrect."5 (Hsueh Tou added a

Ma Ku then said, "Chang Ching said 'Correct'; why do you

COMMENTARY

When the ancients travelled on foot to visit the monasteries
everywhere, they only had this matter on their minds: they
wanted to discern whether the old teacher on the carved wood
seat possessed eyes or did not possess eyes. The people of old
would stay if there was mutual agreement in a single word, and
would leave if they did not agree in one word.
Observe how that Ma Ku went to Chang Ching, circled the
meditation seat thrice, shook his staff once, and stood there
upright. Chang Ching said, "Correct. Correct." (To use) the
sword that kills people, the sword that brings people to life, one
must be a master in his own right.
Hsueh Tou says "Wrong!" This falls on both sides, but if you
go to either side to understand, you will not see Hsueh Tau's
meaning. Ma Ku stood there upright, but tell me, what did he
do it for? Why does Hsueh Tou then say "Wrong"? Where is it
that he is wrong? Chang Ching said "Correct. Correct." Where
is it that he is wrong? Hsueh Tou seems to be sitting there
reading the judgment.
Ma Ku, carrying this word "correct," then went to see Nan
Ch'uan. As before, he circled the meditation seat thrice, shook
his staff once, and stood there upright. Ch'uan said, "Incorrect.
Incorrect." For the sword that kills people, the sword that gives
people life, one must be a master of the school in his own right.
Hsueh Tou says "Wrong!" Chang Ching said, "Correct. Cor-

196

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

rect." Nan Ch'uan said "Incorrect. Incorrect." Are these the
same or different? The first says "Correct": why is he also
wrong? The latter says "Incorrect": why is he too wrong? If you
attain understanding at Chang Ching's saying, you will not
even be able to save yourself: if you attain understanding at
Nan Ch'uan's saying, you can be the teacher of Buddhas and
Patriarchs. Even so, patchrobed monks must prove it them­
selves before they will understand; do not just accept other
people's verbal explanations.
Since Ma Ku's question was the same, why did one say "cor­
rect" and one say "incorrect"? If one is a thoroughly competent
master, a man who has attained great liberation, he must have
a life apart (from "correct" and "incorrect"). One who has not
forgotten mind and objects will certainly be stuck over these
two sides. If you want to clearly understand past and present,
and cut off the tongues of everyone in the world, first you must
clearly apprehend these two "wrongs." This is so because
Hsueh Tou wants to bring up the livingness. If you are a fellow
with blood under your skin, you will naturally not go to the
words and phrases to create interpretations; you will not go to
a donkey-tethering stake to make up theories. Some people say
that Hsueh Tou utters these two "wrongs" on behalf of Ma Ku,
but what has that got to do with it? They are far from knowing
that the ancient's added comments lock off the essential gate;
this side is correct, and that side is also correct, but ultimately
they do not remain on either of the two sides. The librarian
Ch'ing said, "Holding his staff, circling the meditation seat,
'correct' and 'incorrect' are both wrong. The reality of it does
not lie herein."
Have you not read how Yung Chia carne to Ts'ao Ch'i and
saw the Sixth Patriarch? He circled the meditation seat three
times, shook his staff once, and stood erect. The Patriarch said,
"A monk is to have three thousand modes of dignity, and
eighty-four thousand refinements of conduct; where have you
come from, 0 Worthy, that you bear such great self-conceit?"
Why did the Sixth Patriarch say that he bore great self-conceit?
This one did not say "correct" or "incorrect"; "correct" and
"incorrect" are both donkey-tethering stakes. There is only
Hsueh Tou who, pronouncing two "wrongs," has thus attained
something.
Ma Ku said, "Chang Ching said 'correct'; why do you say

Thirty-first Case

197

'incorrect,' Master?" This old fellow didn't spare his eyebrows;
he indulged considerably-Nan Ch'uan said, "Chang Ching is
correct; it's you who are incorrect." One might say that Nan
Ch'uan, seeing a rabbit, released a falcon. Librarian Ch'ing said,
"Nan Ch'uan was excessively doting; whereas he might have
let the matter rest with 'incorrect,' still he went on to bring
out the other's fault for him, saying, 'This is what is turned
around by the power of the wind; eventually it breaks down
and disintegrates."' The Sutra of Complete Enlightenment
says, "This here body of mine is a combination of four major
elements. The so-called defiled form of hair, nails, teeth, skin,
flesh, sinews, bone, marrow, and brains, all return to earth.
Saliva, tears, pus, and blood, all return to water. Warm breath
returns to fire, and movement returns to wind. When the four
major elements each separate, where could this illusory body
be?"" When that Ma Ku circled the meditation seat holding his
staff, already this was what is turned around by the power of
the wind; eventually it breaks down and disintegrates. Then
tell me, ultimately where does the matter of discovering the
source of mind lie? When you get here, you must be a man
made of cast iron in order to realize it.
Have you not read how the scholar Chang Ch'o called on the
Ch'an Master Tsang of Hsi T'ang? He asked, "Do the moun­
tains, rivers, and earth exist or not? Do the Buddhas of the
three times exist or not?" Tsang said, "They exist." Chang
Ch'o the scholar said, "Wrong!" Tsang said, "Who have you
seen?" Ch'o said, "I have seen the Master of Ching Shan: what­
ever I asked about, Ching Shan said it doesn't exist." Tsang
said, "What family do you have?" Ch'o said, "I have a wife and
two children." Tsang then asked, "What family does Ching
Shan have?" Ch'o said, "Ching Shan is an Ancient Buddha; you
should not slander him, Master." Tsang said, "Wait till you are
like Ching Shan; then I'll tell you everything doesn't exist."
Chang Ch'o just bowed his head. A competent teacher of the
sect always wants to melt the sticking points, remove the
bonds, pull out the nails and draw out the pegs for people; he
should not just hold to one side, but sweep to the left and turn
to the right, sweep to the right and turn to the left.
Just observe how Yang Shan went to Chung Yi's place to
thank him for ordination. When Yi saw him coming, he beat
his hand on the meditation seat and said, "Wa wa." Yang Shan

198

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

thereupon stood to the east; then he stood to the west, and
then stood in the middle. After that, once he had finished giv­
ing thanks for ordination, he then retreated and stood there.
Chung Yi said, "Where did you get this concentration?" Yang
Shan said, I took it off the Seal of Ts'ao Ch'i." Chung Yi said,
"You tell me, whom did Ts'ao Ch'i use this concentration to
receive?" Yang Shan said, "To receive the Overnight En­
lightened Guest (Yung Chia)." Yang Shan too asked Chung Yi,
"Master, where did you get this concentration?" Chung Yi
said, "I got this concentration at Ma Tsu's place." Isn't such
conversation by fellows who raise one and understand three,
see the root and pursue the branches?
Lung Ya said to his community, "Those people who pene­
trate the study must pass beyond buddhas and patriarchs.
(Tung Shan) the Master of Hsin Feng said, 'If you see the verbal
teachings of the buddhas and patriarchs as if they were your
mortal enemies, only then will you have the qualifications for
penetrating the study.' If you can't pass beyond them, then you
will be deceived by the patriarchs and buddhas." At the time
there was a monk who asked, "Do the patriarchs and buddhas
have any intention to deceive people or not?" Lung Ya said,
"Tell me, do rivers and lakes have any intention to obstruct
people or not?" He went on to say, "Although rivers and lakes
have no intention to obstruct people, it's just that people now
can't cross them. Therefore, rivers and lakes after all become
barriers to people. You cannot say that rivers and lakes do not
obstruct people. Although the patriarchs and buddhas have no
intention to deceive people, it's just that people now cannot
pass beyond them. So patriarchs and buddhas after all deceive
people. Again, you cannot say that patriarchs and buddhas do
not deceive people. If one can pass beyond the patriarchs and
buddhas, this person surpasses the patriarchs and buddhas.
Still, one must completely realize the intent of the patriarchs
and buddhas: only then can one be equal to those transcendent
people of old. If you have not yet been able to pass through, if
you study the Buddhas and study the Patriarchs, then you'll
have no hope of attaining even in ten thousand aeons." The
monk also asked, "How can I be able to avoid being deceived by
the Patriarchs and Buddhas?" Lung Ya said, "You must be en­
lightened yourself." When you get here, you must be like this.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

This verse resembles the case of Te Shan seeing Kuei Shan:
first (Hsueh Tou) adds two turning words, piercing it through
on one string; then he produces his verse. "This 1Wrong1 and
that 1Wrong1-it is important not to take them away.11 Hsueh
Tau's meaning is that the "wrong11 here and the "wrong1' there
should absolutely not be taken away; if you take them away,
you're mistaken. It is necessary to add this double "wrong"
like this, and thus you realize right away: "The waves are calm
m

t he four seas, the hundred rivers return to the ocean tide.11

How pure the wind, how bright the moon! If you gain under­
standing at these two "wrongs," you will no longer have the
slightest concern: mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers,
what is long is of itself long, and what is short is of itself short;
one breeze every five days, one rainfall every ten days. That is
whv he said, "The waves are calm in the four seas; the hundred
rivers return to the ocean tide."
The latter part eulogizes Ma Ku carrying his staff; "The
standard of the ancient rod is lofty, with twelve gates.11 The
people of old used a whip for a rod; patchrobed monks use the
staff as a rod. The "ancient rod11 is the staff; the pure wind is
higher than the twelve vermillion gates. If you can understand
this two-fold "wrong,11 then your staff will emit light; even the
ancient rod can't be put to use. An Ancient said, "If you know
the staff, your life's study is finished.11 It is also said, "This is
not displaying form and vainly holding to things; the Tathaga­
ta's precious staff has personally left its traces.11 This is in the
same category. When you get here, through all upsets and
downfalls, throughout all times, you attain great freedom.
"In each gate there is a road, empty and desolate." Although
there is a road, it is just that it's empty and desolate. At this
point Hsueh Tou feels that he has indulged, so he goes on to
strike a smashing blow for you; although it is so, still there is a
place which is not desolate. Even if you are an adept, when you
have no illness, still you must seek a bit of medicine to take.

See how he wasi directly leaving, directly entering, directly
going, directly coming-this indeed is the True School of Lin
Chi, to have such dynamic function. If you can go all the way
through, then you can overturn the sky and make it into earth,

Elder Ting was such a fellowi slapped once by Lin Chi, as he
bowed and rose he immediately understood the ultimate. He
was a man of the North, extremely simple and direct. Once he
had attained this, he did not appear in the world thereafter. He
thenceforth made complete use of the ability of Lin Chii un­
avoidably his sharpness came through. One day on the road he
met Yen T'ou, Hsueh Feng, and Ch'in Shan. Yen T'ou asked,
"Where do you come from?" Ting said, "Lin Chi." T'ou said,
"Is the teacher in good health?" Ting said, "He has already
passed on." T'ou said, "We three were going especially to pay
him our respectsi our good fortune is shallow and thin, that we
find he has 'returned to silence.' When the teacher was living,
what did he have to say? Elder, please cite one or two examples
for us." Ting then cited one day when Lin Chi instructed the
assembly by saying, "In the lump of red flesh there is a true
man with no station: he is always going in and out through the
gates of your sensesi those who have not witnessed proof of
this, look! Look!" At the time there was a monk who came
forth and asked, "What is the true man with no station?" Lin
Chi immediately grabbed him and said, "Speak! Speak!" The
monk hesitated, whereupon Lin Chi pushed him away and
said, "The true man of no station: what a piece of crap he is!"
Then Lin Chi returned to the abbot's room.
(Hearing this,) Yen T'ou unconsciously stuck out his tongue
(in awe). Ch'in Shan said, "Why did he not say, 'Not a true man
of no station'?" Ting grabbed him and said, "How far apart are
'a true man of no station' and 'not a true man of no station'?
Speak quickly! Speak quickly!" Ch'in Shan did not speaki his
face turned yellow and green. Yen T'ou and Hsueh Feng ap-

proached and bowed and said, "This novice does not know
good from bad; he has offended you, Elder: we hope you will be
merciful and forgive his error." Ting said, "If not for you two
old fellows, I would have choked this bed-wetting sprite to
death."
Again, once in Chen Chou, as he was returning from a veg­
etarian feast, he rested on a bridge. There he met three lectur­
ing monks. One of them asked, "What is the meaning of
'Where the river of Ch'an is deep, you must plumb the very
bottom'?" Ting grabbed him and was about to throw him off
the bridge, when the other two lecturers frantically tried to
rescue him, saying, "Stop! Stop! He has offended you, Elder,
but we hope you will be merciful." Ting said, "If not for you
two, I would have let him plumb the very bottom."
Observe such methods of his. This is wholly the dynamic
function of Lin Chi. Also take a look at Hsueh Tau's verse:

VERSE

Tuan Chi's entire ability continues in his footsteps;
**The Yellow River is muddy from the very source. The
son inherits the father's work.*
Brought forth, why should it remain at ease�
**Where is iU What can be done about the fact that
there is such a man� Can a man without feet or hands
attain that, or noU *
The great spirit lifted his hand without much ado
**He scares people to death. A little boasting. Striking
once with a whisk, I will not test any further.*
And split apart Flower Mountain's ten million layers.
**The whole world appears at once. It's fallen.*

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tau eulogizes, "Tuan Chi's entire ability continues in
his footsteps; brought forth, why should it remain at ease?"
Only Lin Chi alone continued in the footsteps of Huang Po's3
great ability and great function. Once it is brought forth, it does

not admit of any attempt to discuss it; if you hesitate, you'll
immediately fall into the realm of ignorance.h
The Surangama Sutra says, "Just as when I put my finger on
it, the Ocean Seal emits light, if you arouse your minds even
momentarily, anxiety over the material world will come up
first."
"The great spirit lifted his hand without much ado, and split
apart Flower Mountain's ten million layers." The great spirit
(of the Yellow River) had great supernatural powers; with his
hand he broke open Mt. T'ai Hua and let the water of the
Yellow River run through. Elder Ting's feeling of doubt was
like a massive mountainous heap; struck once by Lin Chi,
immediately he found the tiles had scattered, the ice had
melted.

but can you say he is fast asleep? Sometimes his eyes are like
comets, but can you say he is wide awake? Sometimes he calls

man of the Way or an ordinary man? If you can pass through
here, for the first time you will know the ultimate, and then
you will know how the ancients were so or not so. But tell me,
what time is this? To test, I cite this. Look!

CASE

Ch'en Ts'ao, ministry president, went to see Tzu Fu. When Fu
saw him coming, he immediately drew a circle.1 Ts'ao said,
"My coming here like this has already missed the pointi how
much more so, to go on and draw a circle!"2 Fu thereupon
closed the door of his room. 3
Hsueh Tau said, "Ch'en Ts'ao has just one eye."4

meaning lie? He should give him another circle. Clearly. Ch'en

Ts'ao has a dragon's head, but a snake's tail; at that time he
should have given Tzu Fu such a thrust that he would have had no
gate to advance through, and no road to retreat upon. But tell me,
what further pressure could he bring to bear on him?

COMMENTARY

Ministry president Ch'en Ts'ao was a contemporary of P'ei
Hsiu and Li Ao. b Whenever he saw a monk come, he would
first invite him to a meal, and would give him three hundred
cash, wishing thereby to test the monk. One day Yun Men
came; seeing him, Ch'en Ts'ao immediately asked, "I do not
ask about what is in the Confucian books, and the twelve part
teachings of the three vehicles have their own professors: what
is the purpose of a patchrobed monk's journey on foot?" Yun
Men said, "How many people have you asked?" Ts'ao said, "I
am asking you right now." Yun Men said, "Leaving aside 'right
now' for the moment, what is the meaning of the teachings?"
Ts'ao said, "Yellow scrolls on red rollers." Yun Men said,
"These are written words and letters: what is the meaning of
the teachings?" Ts'ao said, "When the mouth wishes to speak
of it, words flee; when the mind seeks affinity with it, thought
vanishes." Yun Men said,"'When the mouth wishes to speak of
it, words flee' is to refer to maintaining verbalization; 'when
the mind seeks affinity with it, thought vanishes' is to refer to
false conceptualization. What is the meaning of the teach­
ings?" Ts'ao was speechless. Yun Men said, "I have heard it
said that you read the Lotus of Truth scripture; is this true or
not?" Ts'ao said, "True." Yun Men said, "In that scripture it
says that all livelihood and productive labor are not contrary to
the characteristics of reality. But tell me, in the heaven that is
beyond thought and thoughtlessness," right now how many
people fall back from that position?"d Ts'ao again was speech­
less. Yun Men said, "Do not be so careless. A real monk aban­
dons the three scriptures and five discoursese to enter a monas­
tery; after ten or twenty years, he still can do nothing himself.
So how could you, ministry president, be able to understand?"
Ts'ao bowed and said, "I am at fault."
Also one day as (Ch'en Ts'ao) had climbed up in a tower
with a group of officials, they looked out and saw several

208

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

monks coming. One of the officials said, "Those people ap­
proaching are all Ch'an monks." Ts'ao said, "No, they're not."
The official said, "How do you know they're not?" Ts'ao said,
"Wait till they come near, and I will put them to a test for
you." When the monks reached the foot of the tower, Ts'ao
suddenly called out, "0 Elders!" The monks raised their heads.
Ts'ao said to the group of officials, "Didn't you believe what I
said?" There was only one man, Yun Men, whom Ch'en Ts'ao
could not expose.
Ch'en Ts'ao had seen Mu Chou. One day he went to call
upon Tzu Fu. When Fu saw him coming, he immediately drew
a circle. Tzu Fu was an honorable adept in the Kuei-Yang
lineage; he always liked to use the meeting of perspectivesr to
deal with people. When he saw the ministry president Ch'en
Ts'ao coming, he thereupon drew a circular figure. But what
could he do? Ts'ao was after all an adept. and didn't submit to
the deceit of others; he knew himself how to make a test-he
said, "My coming here like this has already missed the point;
how is it worth going on to draw a circle?" Fu closed the door.
This kind of public case is called "discerning the target within
the words, concealing ability within a phrase." Hsueh Tou
says, "Ch'en Ts'ao has just one eye." Hsueh Tou may be said to
have an eye on his forehead. But tell me, where does his mean­
ing lie? (Tzu Fu) should have produced another circular figure;
but if he always acted like this, how could a patchrobed monk
benefit others? Now I ask you, if you were Ch'en Ts'ao at that
moment, what could you have said in order to avoid Hsueh
Tau's saying that he has just one eye? Thus Hsueh Tou kicks
over everything and versifies:

VERSE

Round and round the jewel turns, ringing like jade**With a three foot pole he tries to stir the Yellow River.
Only the Blue-eyed Barbarian (Bodhidharma) could do
it. Made of cast iron.

*

Horses carry it, asses bear it; load it on an iron ship;

I give it to you.*

Share it with an unconcerned traveller of sea and mountain.
**There is someone who has no need of it. If one is a real
unconcerned traveller, he has no use for it. But you must
be a traveller without concern before you will get it. *

**Coming this way, going this way; none can escape.

be done about prawns, mussels, snails, and oysters?
It is necessary to hook a tortoise. *
Hsueh Tau also said, "No patchrobed monk in the world can
;ump out."
**You too are inside it. All are buried in the same hole;
but can you manage to ;ump out, your reverence?·

COMMENTARY

"Round and round the jewel turns, tinkling like jade: horses
carry it, asses bear it; load it on an iron ship." The beginning of
Hsueh Tau's poem just eulogizes the circle. If you can merge
with it, you'll be like a tiger with horns. This bit requires you
to have the bottom fall out of your bucket, your mental machi­
nations to come to an end; throw away gain and loss, right and
wrong all at once, do not make your understanding in terms of
principle anymore, and do not understand it as a mysterious
wonder. Ultimately, how to understand? This must be carried
by horses, borne by asses, loaded on an iron ship. You will only
get it if you see it here. Anyplace else, it cannot be imparted: it
must be taken and shared with an unconcerned traveller of sea
and mountain. If you have the slightest bit of concern in your
belly, you will not be able to take it up properly. Here you must
be a person who is not affected by concerns or absence of con­
cerns, by unpleasant feelings or pleasing situations, or by Bud­
dhas or Patriarchs: only then can you take it up properly. If
there is any Ch'an to seek, any measure of profane or holy
feelings, you will certainly not be able to fully attain mastery.
But once you have attained mastery, how will you understand
his saying, "When fishing for a tortoise, he lowers a cage-trap"?
In fishing for tortoises, only a cage will do. That is why Feng
Hsueh said, "Used to fishing for whales, I scour the great

210

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

ocean; instead I'm disappointed by a frog crawling in the
muddy sand." He also said, "0 great tortoise, do not carry away
the three mountains! I want to walk on the summit of P'eng
Lai." Hsueh Tou also said, "No patchrobed monk in the world
can leap out." If one is a great tortoise, he will not entertain the
view of a patchrobed monk; if one is a patchrobed monk, he
will not entertain the view of a great tortoise.

a special series of circular figures to represent this. Also, various
phases and processes of Buddhist Teaching were represented
symbolically in circles, figures, and words; no doubt at times
these were used as meditation objects.

THIRTY-FOURTH CASE

Yang Shan Asks "Where Have You
Come From?''

CASE

Yang Shan asked a monk, "Where have you just come from?"1
The monk said, "Mount Lu."2
Yang Shan said, "Did you visit Five Elders Peak?"3
The monk said, "I didn't get there."4
Yang Shan said, "You never visited the mountain at all."5
(Later,) Yun Men said, "These words were all for the sake of
compassion; thus they had a conversation in the weeds."6

NOTES

l.

Everyone in the world is the same. Still it is necessary to ask. (The
monk) will inevitably construe it in the ordinary way.

3.

A truthful man is hard to find.

He uses the wind to fan the fire. How could he have ever passed it
by?

4.

Take a step. A red face is not as good as honest speech. He seems
to be at a loss.

Too much ado! He should be careful of his eyebrows. What is this
old fellow's hurry?

COMMENTARY

The point of testing someone is to know him intimately as
soon as he opens his mouth. An Ancient said, "Immeasurably
great people are turned about in the stream of speech." If you
are one who has the eye on your forehead, as soon as it is being

211

212

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

brought up, you immediately know where it comes down. See
their one question, one answer; each is distinctly clear. Why
did Yun Men then say that these words were all for the sake of
compassion, so they had a conversation in the weeds? When
that man of old gets here, he is like a clear mirror on its stand,
like a bright jewel in the palm of the hand: when a foreigner
comes, a foreigner is reflected, and when a native comes, a
native is reflected. Not even a single fly could get past his
scrutiny. But tell me, how is it that there was a conversation in
the weeds for the sake of compassion? It was nevertheless
dangerously steep; getting to this realm, only this fellow could
hold up. This monk had personally come from Mount Lu; why
did (Yang Shan) then say, "You have never visited the moun­
tain"?
Kuei Shan one day asked Yang Shan, "When there are
monks coming from various places, what do you use to test
them?" Yang Shan said, "I have a way of testing." Kuei Shan
said, "Try to show me." Yang Shan said, "Whenever I see a
monk coming, I just lift up my whisk and say to him, 'Do they
have this in other places?' When he has something to say, I just
say to him, 'Leaving this aside for the moment, what about
That?"' Kuei Shan said, "This has been the tooth and nail of
our sect since time immemorial."
Haven't you read how Ma Tsu asked Pai Chang, "Where do
you come from?" Chang said, "From down the mountain." Tsu
said, "Did you meet anyone on the road?" Chang said, "Not at
all." Tsu said, "Why did you not meet anyone at all?" Chang
said, "If I had met anyone, I would mention it to you, teacher."
Tsu said, "How could this have been happening?" Chang said,
"I am at fault." Tsu said, "On the contrary, I am at fault."
Yang Shan's questioning the monk was just like these
examples. At that time, when he said, "Did you ever get to Five
Elders Peak?" if that monk had been a man, he would simply
have said, "A disaster." Instead, he said, "I never got there."
Since this monk was not an adept, why did Yang Shan not act
according to the rule, so as to avoid the many complications
that subsequently appeared? Instead he said, "You never vis­
ited the mountain." That is why Yun Men said, "These words
were all for the sake of compassion, thus they had a conversa­
tion in the weeds." If it were a talk outside the weeds, then it
would not be like this.

COMMENTARY

"Leaving the weeds, entering the weeds; who knows how to
seek them out?" Hsueh Tou after all knows where they are at;
when he gets there, with one hand he upholds, and with the

214

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

other hand he pushes down. "White clouds, layer upon layer;
red sun, clear and bright." This is much like "Grasses in profu­
sion, mist overhanging." At this point there is not even so
much as a single hair that belongs to the ordinary, nor so much
as a single hair that belongs to the holy. The whole world has
never concealed it; each particular cannot cover it. This is
what is called the realm of no-mind; when cold, it doesn't feel
cold, and when hot it doesn't feel hot-the whole thing is one
great gate of liberation. "Looking to the left, there are no flaws;
looking to the right, already old."
Master "Lazy" Ts'an dwelt in seclusion in a stone grotto on
Mount Heng. Emperor Su Tsung of T'ang heard of his name
and sent an emissary to summon him. The emissary went to
his grotto and made the announcement, "The Emperor has a
command; you should rise and give thanks for his favor, Rever­
end." Just then Ts'an poked into his ox-dung fire, took out a
baked yam and ate it; cold nose-water dripped from his chin.
He did not answer at all. The emissary laughed and said, "I
suggest that you wipe off that snot, Reverend." Ts'an said,
"What leisure time do I have to wipe snot for a worldly man?"
After all he never arose. The emissary returned and reported
this to the Emperor. Su Tsung praised him highly. Someone so
pure and calm, so clear and direct as this, is not at the disposal
of others; he just holds still, as though made of cast iron. It is
just like the case of Master Shan Tao, who after the purge never
again became a monk; people called him "the stone-grotto
worker." Whenever he tread the pestle, he forgot the move­
ment of his footsteps. A monk asked Lin Chi, "What is the
essential meaning of the stone grotto worker's forgetfulness of
the movement of his footsteps?" Chi said, "Sunken in a deep
pit."

sound is even better. Underneath there is a man with half-grey

also said, "Mind is the organ, phenomena are the objects: both
are like flaws in a mirror. When the defilement of the flaws is

Manjusri said, "What do they usually use to drink tea?" Cho
was speechless. After all he took his leave and departed. Man­
jusri ordered Ch'un T'i the servant boy to see him to the gate.
When they got to the portals of the gate, Wu Cho asked the
boy, "Before, he said, 'In front three by three; in back, three by
three'; how many is this?" The boy said, "0 Worthy!" Cho
responded "Yes?" The boy said, "How many is th is?" Cho also
asked, "What temple is this?" The boy pointed beyond the
Vajrasattva; when Cho turned his head, the illusory temple and
the boy had vanished completely out of sight: it was just an
empty valley. Later that place was called the Vajra (Adaman­
tine) Cave.
Later on a monk asked Feng Hsueh, "What is the Master of
Ch'ing Liang Mountain?"a Hsueh said, "One phrase did not
settle Wu Cho's question; to this very day he is still a monk
who sleeps in the fields."
If you want to penetrate the peaceful equanimity of actual
truth, so that your feet tread upon the real earth, go to Wu
Cho's words to get attainment; then naturally though you stay
in a cauldron of hot water or the embers of a stove, still you
would not feel hot, and though you stay on cold ice, neither
would you feel cold.
If you want to go through to use the solitary peril, the steep
and sharp, like the Jewel Sword of the Diamond King, go to
Manjusri's words to get attainment; then naturally water
poured will not wet, and wind blowing cannot enter.
Have xou not seen how Ti Tsang of Cheng Chou asked a
monk, "Where have you just come from?" The monk said,
"The South." Tsang said, "How is Buddhism there?" The
monk said, "There is much deliberation." Tsang said, "How
can that compare with us here sowing fields and having a lot of
rice to eat?" Now tell me, is this the same as Manjusri's an­
swer, or is it different? Some say that Wu Cho's answers were
wrong, while in Manjusri's answers there is both snake and
dragon, there is both the ordinary and the sage. What bearing
does this have on it? Can you clearly discern three by three in
front, three by three in back? The first arrow will still light; the
second arrow went deep. Now tell me, how many is this? If you
can pass through here, then a thousand phrases, ten thousand
phrases, are only one phrase. If at this one phrase you can cut

COMMENTARY

When Wu Cho was visiting Mt. Wu T'ai, when he came to a
place on the way where it was wild and rough, Manjusri pro­
duced a temple to take him in for the night. So he asked,
"Where have you just come from?" Cho said, "The South."
Manjusri asked, "How is the Buddhist Teaching being carried
on in the South?" Cho said, "Monks of this Last Age have little
regard for the rules of discipline." Manjusri asked, "How
numerous are the congregations?" Cho said, "Some three
hundred, some five hundred." Wu Cho then asked Manjusri,
"How is it being carried on hereabouts?" Manjusri said, "Ordi­
nary people and sages dwell together; dragons and snakes in­
termingle." Cho asked, "How numerous are the congrega­
tions?" Manjusri said, "In front, three by three; in back, three
by three."
Then they drank tea; Manjusri held up a crystal bowl and

218

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

asked, "Do they also have this in the South?" Cho said, "No."
Manjusri said, "What do they usually use to drink tea?" Cho
was speechless. After all he took his leave and departed. Man­
jusri ordered Ch'un T'i the servant boy to see him to the gate.
When they got to the portals of the gate, Wu Cho asked the
boy, "Before, he said, 'In front three by three; in back, three by
three'; how many is this?" The boy said, "0 Worthy!" Cho
responded "Yes?" The boy said, "How many is this?" Cho also
asked, "What temple is this?" The boy pointed beyond the
Vajrasattva; when Cho turned his head, the illusory temple and
the boy had vanished completely out of sight: it was just an
empty valley. Later that place was called the Vajra (Adaman­
tine) Cave.
Later on a monk asked Feng Hsueh, "What is the Master of
Ch'ing Liang Mountain?"a Hsueh said, "One phrase did not
settle Wu Cho's question; to this very day he is still a monk
who sleeps in the fields."
If you want to penetrate the peaceful equanimity of actual
truth, so that your feet tread upon the real earth, go to Wu
Cho's words to get attainment; then naturally though you stay
in a cauldron of hot water or the embers of a stove, still you
would not feel hot, and though you stay on cold ice, neither
would you feel cold.
If you want to go through to use the solitary peril, the steep
and sharp, like the Jewel Sword of the Diamond King, go to
Manjusri's words to get attainment; then naturally water
poured will not wet, and wind blowing cannot enter.
Have xou not seen how Ti Tsang of Cheng Chou asked a
monk, "Where have you just come from?" The monk said,
"The South." Tsang said, "How is Buddhism there?" The
monk said, "There is much deliberation." Tsang said, "How
can that compare with us here sowing fields and having a lot of
rice to eat?" Now tell me, is this the same as Manjusri's an­
swer, or is it different? Some say that Wu Cho's answers were
wrong, while in Manjusri's answers there is both snake and
dragon, there is both the ordinary and the sage. What bearing
does this have on it? Can you clearly discern three by three in
front, three by three in back? The first arrow will still light; the
second arrow went deep. Now tell me, how many is this? If you
can pass through here, then a thousand phrases, ten thousand
phrases, are only one phrase. If at this one phrase you can cut

off and hold still, in the next moment you will reach this
realm.

VERSE

The thousand peaks twist and turn, the color of indigo.
**But do you see Manjusri?*
Who says Manjusri was conversing with him?
**Even if it were Samantabhadra, I wouldn't pay any
attention. He's already stumbled past.*
It is laughable, "How many the people?" on Ch'ing Liang:

COMMENTARY

"The thousand peaks twist and turn, blue as indigo; who says
Manjusri was conversing with him?" Some say that Hsueh Tou
is just reciting it a second time, without ever eulogizing it. It is
just like a monk asked Fa Yen, "What is a drop of water from
the source of the Ts'ao stream?" Yen said, "A drop of water
from the source of the Ts'ao stream." Also a monk asked Mas­
ter Hui Chueh of Lung Ya, "How does fundamental purity and
clarity suddenly give rise to mountains, rivers, and earth?"
Chueh said, "How does fundamental purity and clarity sud­
denly give rise to mountains, rivers, and earth?" You cannot
say either that these were just repetitions.
The One-Eyed Dragon of Min Ch'ao also versified the mean­
ing of this, with the ability to cover heaven and earth; he said,
Extending throughout the world is the beautiful
monastery:
The Manjusri that fills the eyes is the one conversing.
Not knowing to open the Buddha-eye at his words,

220

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

(Wu Cho) turned his head and saw only the blue
mountain crags.
"Extending throughout the world is the beautiful monastery."
This refers to the illusory temple nestled in the weeds. This is
what is called having the ability to carry out both the provi­
sional and the real together. The Manjusri which fills the eyes
is talking; if you don't know how to open the Buddha-eye at his
words, when you turn your head you'll only see the blue moun­
tain crags. At such a time, could you call it the realm of Man­
jusri, Samantabhadra," or Avalokitesvara?c In essence it is not
this principle. Hsueh Tau just changes Ming Ch'ao's usage;
instead he has a needle and thread-"Ten thousand peaks
twist and turn, blue as indigo." He does not run afoul of the
point and hurt his hand. Within the phrase there is the provi­
sional,

there

is

the

real;

there

is

principle,

there

are

phenomena. Who says Manjusri was conversing with him?
They talked all night, but he didn't know it was Manjusri.
Later Wu Cho stayed on Mt. Wu T'ai and worked as a cook.
Every time Manjusri appeared on the rice pot, Wu Cho lifted
the rice stirrer and hit him. Still, this is drawing the bow after
the thief has left.
This time, as soon as he said, "How is the Buddhist Teach­
ing being carried on in the South?" he should have hit him
right on the spine; then he would have gotten somewhere.
"It's laughable, 'How many are the people?' on Ch'ing
Liang." There is a sword in Hsueh Tau's laughter. If you can
understand what he's laughing about, you will see the other's
saying, "In front three by three; in back three by three."

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

a.

Ch'ing Liang ("Pure and Cool") was another name for Mt. Wu
T'ai. One of the five holy mountains of China, it was traditionally
thought to be the abode of Manjusri, who symbolizes wisdom and
knowledge. The Vajra, or Diamond, ts also a symbol of wisdom,
because it can cut through everything, while itself being firm and
indestructible.

b.

Samantabhadra, universal goodness, is the bodhisattva represent­
ing the ultimate principle.

c.

Avalokitesvara is the bodhisattva representmg compassion.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

Great Master Chao Hsien of the Deer Park at Ch'ang Sha suc­
ceeded to the Dharma of Nan Ch'uan; he was a contemporary
of Chao Chou and Tzu Hu. The point of his wit was sharp and
swift. If anyone asked about the Teachings, he would then give
him an explanation of the Teachings; if someone wanted a
verse, he would then give a verse. If you wanted to have a
meeting of adepts, then he would have a meeting of adepts
with you.
Yang Shan was usually considered foremost in having a
sharp intellect. Once as he was enjoying the moon along with
Ch'ang Sha, Yang Shan pointed at the moon and said,
"Everyone has this; it's just that they can't use it." Sha said,
"Quite true. So, shall I have you use it?" Yang Shan said, "Try
to use it yourself." Sha kicked him over with one blow. Yang
Shan got up and said, "Respected Uncle, you are just like a
tiger." Hence, people later called Ch'ang Sha "Ts'en the Tiger."
One day as Sha returned from a stroll in the mountains, the
head monk, who was also a man of Sha's congregation, asked
him, "Where are you coming from, Master?" Sha said, "I come
from a stroll in the mountains." The head monk asked, "Where
did you go?" Sha said, "First I went following the fragrant
grasses; then I returned pursuing the falling flowers." Only a
man who had cut off the ten directions could be like this. The
Ancients, in leaving and entering, never ever failed to be mind­
ful of this Matter. See how the host and guest shift positions
together; confronting the situation directly, neither overlaps
the other. Since he was wandering in the mountains, why did
the monk ask, "Where did you go?" If he had been one of
today's followers of Ch'an, he would have said, "I came to the
inn on Mount Chia." See how that man of old did not have
even the slightest hair of reason or judgement, and that he had
no place to abide: that is why he said, "First I went following
the fragrant grasses; then I returned pursuing the falling flow­
ers." The head monk then followed his idea and said to him
"How very much like the sense of springtime!" Sha said, "It
even surpasses the autumn dew dripping on the lotuses."
Hsueh Tou says on behalf (of the monk), "Thanks for your
reply," as the final word. This too falls on both sides but ulti­
mately does not remain on either side.

Thirty-sixth Case

223

In the past there was a scholar, Chang Ch'o, who upon read­
ing the Sutra of the Thousand Names of Buddha, asked, "Of
the hundreds and thousands of Buddhas, I have only heard their
names; what lands do they dwell in, and do they convert beings
or not?" Ch'ang Sha said, "Since Ts'ui Haob wrote his poems in

the Golden Crane Pavillion, have you ever written or not?"
Ch'o said, "No." Sha said, "When you have some free time,
you should write one."
Ts'en the Tiger's usual way of helping people was like jewels
turning, gems revolving; he wanted people to understand im­
mediately on the face of it. The verse says,

VERSE

The earth is clear of any dustOpen wide the doors and windows-who is under the

eaves? None can miss this. The world is at peace.
Whose eyes do not open?

One must emit a great radiant light from his forehead
before this is possible. Why scatter dirt and sand?
First he went following the fragrant grasses,
He's slipped quite a bit. It's not just one instance of falling

into the weeds. Fortunately it happens that he already
said this before.
Then he returned pursuing the falling flowers.

Everywhere is completely real. Luckily he came back.
Under his feet the mud is three feet deep.
A weary cranec alights on a withered tree,

Accompanying him left and right, he adds a phrase. Still
there are so many idle concerns?
A mad monkey cries on the ancient terrace.

After all it depends on personal application of effort. It is
impossible either to add a phrase or to take a phrase away.
Ch'ang Sha's boundless meaning! strike. What does the final phrase say? Bury them all in

one pit. He's fallen into the ghost cave.

224

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Bah!
A man in the weeds; this is drawing the bow after the
thief has gone. Still, he can't be let go.

COMMENTARY

Take this public case along with Yang Shan's asking a monk,
"Where have you just come from?" The monk said, "Mount
Lu." Yang Shan said, "Did you visit the Five Elders Peak?" The
monk said, "I didn't get there." Yang Shan said, "You never
visited the mountain at all." Distinguish the black and white,
and see if they are the same or if they are different. At this
point, mental machinations must come to an end, and con­
scious knowledge be forgotten, so that over mountains, rivers,
and earth, plants, people, and animals you have no leaking at
all. If you are not like this, the Ancients called that "still re­
maining in the realm of surpassing wonder."
Haven't you seen how Yun Men said, "Even if you realize
that there is no trouble at all in the mountains, rivers, and
earth, still this is a turning phrase: when you do not see any
forms, this is only half the issue. You must further realize that
there is a time when the whole thing is brought up, the single
opening upward; only then can you sit in peace?" If you can
pass through, then as before mountains are mountains, rivers
are rivers; each abides in its own state, each occupies its own
body. You will be like a completely blind man. Chao Chou
said,
The cock crows in the early morning;
Sadly I see as I rise how worn out I am;

I haven't a kilt or a shirt,
Just the semblance of a robe.
My loincloth has no seat, my pants no opening­
On my head are three or five pecks of grey ashes.
Originally I intended to practice to help save others;
Who would have suspected that instead I would
become an idiot!

If one can truly reach this realm, whose eyes would not open?
Though you go through upsets and spills, all places are this
realm, all places are this time and season. "The ten directions

Thirty-sixth Case

225

are w ithout walls, and the four quarters are without gates."
That is why he said, "First I went following the fragrant grass­
es; then I returned pursuing the falling flowers." Skillful in­
deed, Hsueh Tau just goes and adds a phrase to his left and a
phrase to his right, just like a poem. "The weary crane alights
on a withered tree. The mad monkey cries on an ancient ter­
race." When Hsueh Tau has drawn it out this far, he realizes
how he has indulged himself: suddenly he says, "Ch'ang Sha's
boundless meaning-Bah!" This was like having a dream but
suddenly awakening. Though Hsueh Tau gave a shout, he still
didn't completely finish the matter. If it were up to me, I would
do otherwise: Ch'ang Sha's boundless meaning-dig out the
ground and bury it deeper.

P'an Shan's There Is Nothing in the
World

POINTER

It is futile effort to linger in thought over the action of a light­
ning bolt: when the sound of thunder fills the sky, you will
hardly have time to cover your ears. To unfurl the red flag of
victory over your head, whirl the twin swords behind your
ears-if not for a discriminating eye and a familiar hand, how
could anyone be able to succeed?
Some people lower their heads and linger in thought, trying
to figure it out with their intellect. They hardly realize that
they are seeing ghosts without number in front of their skulls.
Now tell me, without falling into intellect, without being
caught up in gain or loss, when suddenly there is such a dem­
onstration to awaken you, how will you reply? To test, I cite
this to see.

Thirty-seventh Case

227

COMMENTARY

Master Pao Chi of Mount P'an in Yu Chou in the far north was
a venerable adept succeeding to Ancestor Ma. Later he pro­
duced one man, P'u Hua. When the Master was about to pass
on, he said to the community, "Is there really anyone who can
depict my true likeness?" The people all drew likenesses and
presented them to the Master. The Master scolded every one of
them. P'u Hua came forth and said, "I can depict it." The
Master said, "Why do you not show it to me?" P'u Hua im­
mediately turned a somersault and left. The Master said, "La­
ter on, this guy will appear crazy to teach others."
One day, he said to the community, "There is nothing in the
triple world; where can mind be found? The elements are basi­
cally empty; how can a Buddha abide? The polar star does not
move; quiet and still, without traces, once presented face to
face, there is no longer anything else."
Hsueh Tau takes up two phrases and eulogizes them; this
here is raw gold, a rough jewel. Have you not heard it said,
"Curing illness does not depend on a donkey-load of
medicine." Why do I say I would have hit him before he fin­
ished speaking? Just because he was wearing stocks, giving
evidence of his crimes.
An Ancient said, "When you hear mention of the phrase
beyond sound, do not go seeking it in your mind." But tell me,
what was his meaning? Just like a rushing stream crossing a
sword; thunder rolls, a comet flies. If you hesitate and seek it in
thought, even though a thousand Buddhas appeared in the
world, you would grope around without finding them. But if
you are one who has deeply entered the inner sanctum, pierced
the bone and pierced the marrow, seen all the way through,
then P'an Shan will have suffered a loss. If you are smeared
with mud and dripping with water, turning about on the pile of
sound and form, you have still never seen P'an Shan even in a
dream. My late master Wu Tsu said, "Pass beyond the Other
Side, and only then will you have any freedom."
Have you not seen how the Third Patriarch said, "Grasp it,
and you lose balance and surely enter a false path. Let go natu­
rally; there is neither going nor abiding in essence." If here you
say that there is neither Buddha nor Dharma, still you have

228

gone into a ghost cave. The Ancients called this the Deep Pit of
Liberation. Originally it was a good causal basis, but it brings
on a bad result. That is why it is said that a non-doing, uncon­
cerned man is still oppressed by golden chains. Still, you must
have penetrated all the way to the bottom before you will
realize it. If you can say what cannot be said, can do what
cannot be done, this is called the place of turning the body.
There is nothing in the triple world; where can mind be found?
If you make an intellectual interpretation, you will just die at
his words; Hsueh Tou's view is piercing and penetrating. Thus
he versifies:

VERSE

There is nothing in the triple world;

The words are still in our ears.
Where can mind be foundt

It is not worth the trouble to mention again. See for your­
self. I strike and say, "What is this?"
The white clouds form a canopy;
Adding a head to a head. A thousand layers, ten thousand

layers.

Do you hear it? They come along with each other. Each
hearing is enough to lament.

After all he's dragging in mud and dripping with water.
Where is he? Immediately I strike.

Thirty-seventh Case

229

COMMENTARY

"Ulere is nothing in the triple world; where can mind be
found?" Hsueh Tau makes a verse which resembles the Flower
Garland Cosmos.a Some people say he sings it out from the
midst of nothingness, but anyone with his eyes open would
never understand in this way. Hsueh Tau goes to (P'an Shan's)
side and drapes two phrases on him, saying, "The white clouds
form a canopy; the flowing spring makes a lute."
When Su Tung P'o, scholar of the Imperial Han Lin
Academy, saw Chao Chueh, he made a verse which said,
The sound of the valley stream is itself the Vast
Eternal Tongue;
Are not the colors of the mountains the Pure Body?
Since evening, eighty-four thousand verses;
Another day, how could I quote them to others?

Hsueh Tau borrows the flowing spring to make a long tongue;
that is why he says, "No one understands." The harmony of
this tune requires you to be a connoisseur before you can ap­
preciate it. If you are not such a person, it is useless to take the
trouble to incline an ear to it. An Ancient said, "Even a deaf
man can sing a foreign song; good or bad, high or low, he
doesn't hear at all." Yun Men said, "When it is raised, if you do
not pay attention, you will miss it; if you want to think about
it, in what aeon will you ever awaken?" Raising is the essence,
paying attention is the function; if you can see before it is
brought up, before any indications are distinguishable, then
you will occupy the essential bridge; if you can see at the
moment when the indications are distinguishable, then you
will have shining and function. If you see after the indications
are distinct, you will fall into intellection.
Hsueh Tau is exceedingly compassionate, and goes on to say
to you, "When the rain has passed, the autumn water is deep in
the evening pond." This verse has been discussed and judged by
someone who praised Hsueh Tau for having the talent of a Han
Lin scholar.b "Ule rain passed, the autumn water is deep in the
evening pond." Still you must set eyes on it quickly; if you
tarry in doubt, then you will look without seeing.

Feng Hsueh's Workings of the
Iron axa

POINTER

If we discuss the gradual, it is going against the ordinary to
merge with the Way: in the midst of a bustling market place,
seven ways up and down and eight ways across.
If we discuss the sudden, it doesn't leave a hint of a trace; a
thousand sages cannot find it.

If, on the other hand, we do not set up sudden or gradual,
then what? To a quick person, one word; to a quick horse, one
blow of the whip. At such a time, who is the master? As a test, I
cite this to see.

CASE

At the government headquarters in Ying Chou, Feng Hsueh
entered the hall and said,t "The Patriarchal Masters' Mind Seal
is formed like the workings of the Iron Ox:2a when taken away,
the impression remains;3 when left there, then the impression
is ruined.4 But if neither removed nor left there,S is sealing
right or is not sealing right? "6
At that time there was a certain Elder Lu P'i who came forth
and said, "I have the workings of the Iron Ox:7 please, Teacher,
do not impress the seal."8
Hsueh said, "Accustomed to scouring the oceans fishing for
whales, I regret to find instead a frog crawling in the muddy
sand."9
P'i stood there thinking.10 Hsueh shouted and said, "Elder,
why do you not speak further? "11 P'i hesitated; 12 Hsueh hit
him with his whisk.D Hsueh said, "Do you still remember the
words? Try to quote them."14 As P'i was about to open his
mouth,t5 Hsueh hit him again with his whisk.

Thirty-eighth Case

233

COMMENTARY

Feng Hsueh was a venerable adept in the lineage of Lin Chi.
First Lin Chi was in Huang Po's community. As he was
planting pine trees, Huang Po said to him, "Deep in the moun­
tains here, why plant so many pine trees?" Chi said, "For one
thing, to provide scenery for the monastery; second, to make a
signpost for people of later generations." Having spoken, he
hoed the ground once. Po said, "Although you are right, you
have already suffered twenty blows of my staff." Chi struck the
ground one more time and whistled under his breath. Po said,
"With you, my school will greatly flourish in the world."
Che of Ta Kuei said, "Lin Chi in his way seemed to invite
trouble in a peaceful area; nevertheless, only when immutable
in the face of danger can one be called a real man."
Huang Po said, "My school, corning to you, will greatly
flourish in the world." He seems to be fond of his child, un­
aware of being unseemly.
Later, Kuei Shan asked Yang Shan, "Did Huang Po at that
time only entrust his bequest to Lin Chi alone, or is there yet
anyone else?" Yang Shan said, "There is, but the age is so
remote that I do not want to mention it to you, Master." Kuei
Shan said, "Although you are right, I still want to know; just
mention it and let's see." Yang Shan said, "One man will point
south; in Wu-yueh the order will be carried out, and coming to
a great wind, then it will stop." This foretold of Feng Hsueh
("Wind Cave").
Feng Hsueh first studied with Hsueh Feng for five years. As
it happened, he asked for help with this story: "As Lin Chi
entered the hall, the head monks of both halls simultaneously
shouted. A monk asked Lin Chi, 'Are there guest and host, or
not?' Chi said, 'Guest and host are evident.'"Feng Hsueh asked,
"What is the inner meaning of this?" Hsueh Feng said, "In the
past I went along with Yen T'ou or Ch'in Shan to see Lin Chi;
on the way, we heard he had already passed on. If you want to
understand his talk about guest and host, you should call upon
venerable adepts in the stream of his school."
One day he finally saw Nan Yuan. He recited the preceding
story and said, "I have come especially to see you personally."
Nan Yuan said, "Hsueh Feng is an Ancient Buddha."

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

One time he saw Ching Ch'ing. Ch'ing asked him, "Where
have you just come from?" Hsueh said, "I come from the East."
Ch'ing said, "And did you cross the little (Ts'ao) river?" Hsueh
said, "The great ship sails alone through the sky; there are no
little rivers to cross." Ch'ing said, "Birds cannot fly across mir­
ror lake and picture mountain; have you not merely overheard
another's remark?" Hsueh said, "Even the sea fears the power
of a warship; sails flying through the sky, it crosses the five
lakes." Ch'ing raised his whisk and said, "What about this?"
Hsueh said, "What is this?" Ch'ing said, "After all, you don't
know." Hsueh said, "Appearing, disappearing, rolling up and
rolling out, I act the same as you, Teacher." Ch'ing said, "Cast­
ing auguring sticks, you listen to the empty sound; fast asleep,
you are full of gibberish." Hsueh said, "When a marsh is wide,
it can contain a mountain; a cat can subdue a leopard." Ch'ing
said, "I forgive your crime and pardon your error; you better
leave quickly." Hsueh said, "If I leave, I lose." Then he went
out; when he got to the Dharma Hall, he said to himself, "Big
man, the case is not yet finished; how then can you quit?"
Then he turned around and went into the abbot's room. As
Ching Ch'ing sat there, Hsueh asked, "I have just now offered
my ignorant view and insulted your venerable countenance;
humbly favored by the Teacher's compassion, I have not yet
been given punishment for my crime." Ching Ch'ing said,
"Just awhile ago you said you came from the East: did you not
come from Ts'ui Yen?" Hsueh said, "Hsueh Tou actually lies
east of Pao Kai." Ching Ch'ing said, "If you don't chase the lost
sheep, crazy interpretations cease. Instead you come here and
recite poems." Hsueh said, "When you meet a swordsman on
the road, you should show your sword; do not offer poetry to
one who is not a poet." Ch'ing said, "Put the poetry away right
now and try to use your sword a little." Hsueh said, "A decapi­
tated man carried the sword away." Ch'ing said, "You not only
violate the method of the teaching; you also show your own
fat-headedness." Hsueh said, "Unless I violate the method of
the teaching, how could I awaken to the mind of an Ancient
Buddha?" Ch'ing said, "What do you call the mind of an An­
cient Buddha?" Hsueh said, "Again you grant your allowance;
now what do you have, Teacher?" Ch'ing said, "This patch­
robed one from the East cannot distinguish beans from wheat. I
have only heard of ending without finishing; how can you

Thirty-eighth Case

235

finish by forcing an end?" Hsueh said, "The immense billows
rise a thousand fathoms; the clear waves are not other than
water." Ch'ing said, "When one phrase cuts off the flow,
myriad impulses cease." Hsueh thereupon bowed. Ch'ing
tapped him three times with his whisk and said, "Exceptional
indeed. Now sit and have tea."
When Feng Hsueh first came to Nan Yuan, he entered the
door without bowing. Yuan said, "When you enter the door,
you should deal with the host." Hsueh said, "I ask the Teacher
to make a definite distinction." Yuan slapped his knee with his
left hand. Hsueh immediately shouted. Yuan slapped his knee
with his right hand. Hsueh again shouted. Yuan raised his left
hand and said, "This one I concede to you." Then he raised his
right hand and said, "But what about this one?" Hsueh said,
"Blind!" Yuan then raised his staff. Hsueh said, "What are you
doing? I will take that staff away from you and hit you,
Teacher; don't say I didn't warn you. Yuan then threw the
staff down and said, "Today I have been made a fool of by this
yellow-faced riverlander." Hsueh said, "Teacher, it seems you
are unable to hold your bowl, yet are falsely claiming you're
not hungry." Yuan said, "Haven't you ever reached this place?"
Hsueh said, "What kind of talk is this?" Yuan said, "I just
asked." Hsueh said, "Still I can't let you go." Yuan said, "Sit
awhile and drink some tea."
See how an excellent student naturally has a sharp and
dangerous edge to his personality. Even Nan Yuan couldn't
really handle him. The next day, Nan Yuan just posed an ordi­
nary question, saying "Where did you spend this summer?"
Hsueh said, "I passed the summer along with Attendant Kuo at
the Deer Gate." Yuan said, "So really you had already person­
ally seen an adept when you came here." Yuan also said, "What
did he say to you?" Hsueh said, "From beginning to end he only
taught me to always be the master." Yuan immediately struck
him and drove him out of the abbot's room; he said, "What is
the use of a man who accepts defeat?"
Hsueh henceforth submitted. In Nan Yuan's community he
worked as the gardener. One day Nan Yuan came to the garden
and questioned him; he said, "How do they bargain for the staff
in the South?" Hsueh said, "They make a special bargain. How
do they bargain for it here, Teacher?" Nan Yuan raised his staff
and said, "Under the staff, acceptance of birthlessness; facing

236

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

the situation without deferring to the teacher." At this Feng
Hsueh opened up in great enlightenment.
At this time the five dynasties were divided and at war. The
governor of Ying Chou invited the Master (Feng Hsueh) to pass
the summer there. At this time the one school of Lin Chi
greatly flourished. Whenever he questioned and answered, or
gave out pointers, invariably his words were sharp and fresh;
gathering flowers, forming brocade, each word had a point.
One day the governor requested the Master to enter the hall
to teach the assembly. The Master said, "The Patriarchal
Teacher's Mind Seal is formed like the workings of the Iron Ox.
Removed, the impression remains; left, the impression is
ruined. But if you neither take it away nor keep it there, is it
right to use the seal or not?"
Why is it not like the workings of a stone man or a wooden
horse, only like the workings of an Iron Ox? There is no way for
you to move it: wherever you go the seal remains; as soon as
you stop, the seal is broken, causing you to shatter into a
hundred fragments. But if you neither go nor stay, should you
use the seal or not? See how he gives out indications; you
might say there is bait on the hook.
At this time there was an Elder Lu P'i in the audience. He
also was a venerable adept in the tradition of Lin Chi. He dared
to come forth and reply to his device; thus he turned his words
and made a question, undeniably unique; "I have the workings
of an Iron Ox; I ask you, Master, not to impress the seal." But
what could he do? Feng Hsueh was an adept; he immediately
replied to him, saying, "Accustomed to scouring the oceans
fishing for whales, I regret to find instead a frog crawling in the
muddy river sand." And there is an echo in the words. Yun
Men said, "Trailing a hook in the four seas, just fishing for a
hideous dragon; the mysterious device beyond convention is to
seek out those who understand the self."
In the vast ocean, twelve buffalo carcasses are used as bait
for the hooks; instead he has just snagged a frog. But there is
nothing mysterious or wonderful in these words; and neither is
there any principle to judge. An Ancient said, "It is easy to see
in the phenomenon: if you try to figure it out in your mind, you
will lose contact with it." Lu P'i stood there thinking: "Seeing
it, if you don't take it, it will be hard to find again even in a

Thirty-eighth Case

23 7

thousand years." What a pity! That is why it is said, "Even if
you can explain a thousand scriptures and commentaries, it is
hard to utter a phrase appropriate to the moment."
The fact is that Lu P'i was searching for a good saying to
answer Feng Hsueh; he didn't want to carry out the order, and
suffered Feng Hsueh's thoroughgoing use of his ability to "cap­
ture the flag and steal the drum." He was unremittingly
pressed back, and simply couldn't do anything. As a proverb
says, "When an army is defeated, it cannot be swept up with a
grass broom." In the very beginning it is still necessary to seek
a tactic to oppose the adversary, but if you wait till you've
come up with one, your head will have fallen to the ground.
The governor too had studied a long time with Feng Hsueh;
he knew to say, "The Law of Buddhas and the Law of Kings are
one." Hsueh said, "What have you seen?" The governor said,
"If you do not settle what should be settled, instead you bring
on disorder." Feng Hsueh was all one whole mass of spirit, like
a gourd floating on the water; press it down and it rolls over;
push it and it moves. He knew how to explain the Dharma
according to the situation; if it did not accord with the situa­
tion, it would just be false talk. Hsueh thereupon left the seat.

VERSE

Having caught Lu P'i, he makes him mount the Iron Ox:
Among a thousand people, ten thousand, still he wants to
show his skill. The general of a defeated army need not be
decapitated a second time.
The spear and armor of the Three Profundities have never been
easily opposed;
The one whose move it is, is confused. He accepts disaster
like receiving good fortune and accepts submission like
encountering opposition.
By the castle of the King of Ch'u, the tidal waterWhat tidal water are you talking about? Vastly extensive,
it fills heaven and earth. Even were it the four seas, he
would still reverse their flow.

Shouting once he caused its flow to turn back.
This one shout not only cuts off your tongue; oh! it star­
tles the Iron Ox of Shensi into a run and frightens the
Great Colossus of Chia Choub to death.

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou knew Feng Hsueh to have such a style, so he
eulogized him by saying, "Having caught Lu P'i, he mounts
him on the Iron Ox; the spear and armor of the three profun­
dities have never been easily opposed." In the tradition of Lin
Chi there are three profundities and three essentials: within
any one phrase there must be inherent three profundities; in
one profundity there must be inherent three essentials. A
monk asked Lin Chi, "What is the primary phrase?" Chi said,
When the seal of the three essentials is lifted, the
red mark is narrow;
Without admitting hesitation, host and guest are
distinct.
"What is the secondary phrase?"
How can subtle discernment admit of no question­
ingt
Expedients do not go against the ability to cut off
the streams.
"What is the third phrase?"
Just observe the playing of puppets on the stage:
The pulling of the strings depends on the man behind the scenes.
In Feng Hsueh's one phrase, he is immediately equipped with
the spear and armor of the three profundities; with seven ac­
coutrementsc at his side, it is not easy to oppose him. If he were
not so, how could he have handled Lu P'i?
Finally, Hsueh Tou wants to bring out the active edge of the
Lin Chi line: do not speak only of Lu P'i-even by the castle of
the King of Ch'u, the great waves, vast and extensive, the white
breakers flooding the sky, all return to the source; just using a
single shout is all that's needed to make them reverse their
course.

COMMENTARY

People, do you know the point of this monk's questions and
the point of Yun Men's answers? If you do know, their two
mouths are alike without a single tongue. If you do not know,
you will not avoid being fatheaded.
A monk asked Hsuan Sha, "What is the Pure Body of Real­
ity?" Sha said, "Dripping with pus." He had the adamantine
eye: as a test, I ask you to try to discern it.
Yun Men was not the same as others. Sometimes he held
still and stood like a wall ten miles high, with no place for you
to draw near. Sometimes he would open out a path for you, die
along with you and live along with you.
Yun Men's tongue was very subtlei some people say he was
answering him figurativelyi but if you understand it this way,
then tell me where Yun Men is at. This was a household affairi
do not try to figure it out from outside. This was the reason Pai
Chang said, "Manifold appearances and myriad forms, and all
spoken words, each should be turned and returned to oneself
and made to turn freely." Going to where life springs forth, he
immediately speaksi if you try to discuss it and seek it in
thought, immediately you have fallen into the secondary
phase. Yung Chia said, "When the Body of Reality awakens
fully, there is not a single thingi the inherent nature of the
original source is the natural real Buddha."
Yun Men tested this monki the monk was also a member of
his household and was himself a longtime student. He knew
the business of the household, so he went on to say, "What is it
like to go on like this?"Men said, "A golden-haired lion." But
tell me, is this agreeing with him or not agreeing with him? Is
this praising him or censuring him? Yen T'ou said, "If you
engage in a battle, each individual stands in a pivotal position."
It is also said, "He studies the living phrasei he does not study
the dead phrase. If you get understanding at the living phrase,
you will never ever forgeti if you get understanding at the dead
phrase, you will be unable to save yourself."
Another monk asked Yun Men, "Is it true or not that 'the
Buddha Dharma is like the moon in the water'?" Yun Men
said, "There is no way through the clear waves." The monk
went on to say, "How did you manage?" Yun Men said,

242

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"Where does this second question come from?" The monk
said, "How is it when going on in just this way?" Yun Men
said, "Further complications block the mountain path."
You must realize that this matter does not rest in words and
phrases: like sparks from struck flint, like the brilliance of
flashing lightning, whether you reach it or not, you still will
not avoid losing your body and life. Hsueh Tou is someone who
is there: so he produces his verse from that very place.

VERSE

A flowering hedge:

The words are still in our ears.
Don't be fatheaded!
Such people are numerous as hemp and millet seeds. Still,
there are some who are not.
The marks are on the balance arm, not on the scale pan.
Too complicated! Everyone should go to his own place
and introspect. He hasn't avoided talking about principle.
"So just be like this"He swallows the date whole.
How pointless!
Take what's yours and get out. Clearly. You should not
mistakenly blame Yun Men.
A golden-haired lion-everybody look!

He lets out one or a half. Still they are dogs. Yun Men is
also a man from P'u Chou escorting a thief.

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou sizes up the audience to give his order; he makes
the harpstring move and distinguishes the tune. With each
phrase he continues the judgement. This one verse is not at
variance with the form for quoting the Ancients: "A flowering
hedge"; then he says, "Don't be fatheaded." People all say that
Yun Men was responding figuratively; they all make up emo­
tional interpretations to understand him. Hsueh Tou therefore

Thirty-ninth Case

243

gives his own fodder and says, "Don't be fatheaded." All in all,
Yun Men's meaning does not lie where the flowering hedge is;
that is why Hsueh Tau says, "The marks are on the balance
arm, not on the scale pan." This one phrase is excessively
indulgent. In the water there is originally no moon; the moon
is in the sky. This is like the marks being on the balance arm,
not on the scale pan. But tell me, which is the balance? If you
can discern it clearly, you will not tum away from Hsueh Tau.
When that man of old got to this point, he was undeniably
compassionate. Clearly he says to you, "It's not here; it's over
there." But tell me, what place is that "over there"? This
finishes the eulogizing of their first statements; afterwards he
versifies the monk's saying, "What is it like when just going on
like this?" Hsueh Tau says that this monk still has no point.
But tell me, is this meeting in the light or meeting in darkness?
Did he speak this way from understanding, or did he speak thus
without understanding?

"A

golden-haired

lion-everyone

look!" Do you see the golden-haired lion? Look!

TRANSLATORS NOTES

The Golden-haired Lion is used in the Hua Yen school to sym­
bolize the cosmos as the mutual interpenetration of the universal
and the particular, of principle (relativity, emptiness of inherent
fixed reality) and phenomena (the myriads of things and events).
The Lion's whole body is reflected in each and every hair: thus
there is an infinity of infinities within the whole, with each par­
ticular hair reflected in and reflecting the others ad infinitum. In a
general way the Golden-haired Lion represents reality, or the em­
bodiment of reality. Manjusri, the bodhisattva who stands for
wisdom and knowledge, is depicted as riding the Golden-haired
Lion.

COMMENTARY

The officer Lu Hsuan studied for a long time with Nan Ch'uan.
He always kept his mind on essential nature, and he immersed
himself in the Discourses of Chao. One day as they sat, he
happened to bring up these two lines, considering them re­
markable. He questioned, "Master of the Teachings Chao said,
'Heaven, earth, and I have the same root; myriad things and I
are one body.' This is quite marvelous." Master of the Teach­
ings Seng Chao was an eminent monk of Chin times (latter
4th-early 5th centuries A.D.); he was together with Tao Sheng,
Tao Jung, and Seng Jui in the school of Kumarajiva. They were
called the Four Sages.
When (Seng Chao) was young, he enjoyed reading Chuang
Tzu and Lao Tzu. Later, as he was copying the old translation
of the Vimalakirti Scripture, he had an enlightenment. Then he
knew that Chuang and Lao still were not really thoroughgoing.
Therefore he compiled all the scriptures and composed four
discourses.
What Chuang and Lao intended to say was that "heaven and
earth are greatness of form; my form is also thus; we are alike
born in the midst of empty nothingness." Chuang and Lao's
overall meaning just discusses equalizing things; Seng Chao's
overall meaning says that nature all returns to self. Have you
not seen how his discourse says, "The ultimate man is empty
and hollow, without form; yet none of the myriad things are
not his own doing. Who can understand that myriad things are
his own self? Only a sage, I wot."
Although there are spirits and there are humans, there are
the wise and the sage, each is distinct, but all alike have one
nature and one substance.
An Ancient said, "Heaven and earth, the whole world, is just

one self; when cold, it is cold throughout heaven and earth;
when hot, it is hot throughout heaven and earth. When it
exists, all throughout heaven and earth exists; when it doesn't
exist, heaven and earth do not exist. When affirmed, all
throughout heaven and earth is; when denied, all throughout
heaven and earth is not."
Fa Yen said,

246

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

He he he I I I
South north east west, everything is all right.
All right or not all right,
Only for me there is nothing not all right.
That is why it was said, "In the heavens and on earth, only I
alone am honorable." As Shih T'ou read the Discourse of Chao,
when he got to this place, "Understand myriad things as one­
self," he was vastly and greatly enlightened. Later he composed
the book Ts'an T'ung Ch'i ("Merging of Difference and Same­
ness"), which also does not go beyond this meaning.
See how (Lu Hsuan) questioned; tell me, what root do they
share? Which body do they have in common? When he got
here, still he was undeniably unique: how could this be the
same as an ordinary man's ignorance of the height of the sky or
the breadth of the earth? How could there be such a thing?
Lu Hsuan's questioning in this manner was indeed quite
exceptional, but he did not go beyond the meaning of the
Teachings. If you say that the meaning of the Teachings is the
ultimate paradigm, then why did the World Honored One also
raise the flower?a What did the Patriarchal Teacher come from
the West for?
Nan Ch'uan's way of answering used the grip of a patch­
robed monk to pull out the painful spot for the other, and broke
up his nest; he pointed at a flower in the garden and called to
the officer, saying, "People these days see this flower as though
it were a dream." This is like leading the man to the edge of a
ten thousand fathom cliff and giving him a push, causing his
life to be cut off. If you were pushed over on level ground, even
till Maitreya Buddha was born in the world, you still would
simply be unable to accomplish the cutting off of life.
It is also like a man in a dream; though he wants to awaken,
he cannot wake up; called by another, he awakens. If Nan
Ch'uan's eyes were not true, he would certainly have been
befuddled by Lu. See how he talks; yet undeniably he is dif­
ficult to understand. If the action of your eyes is alive, you will
experience it like the superb flavor of ghee; if you are dead, you
will hear it and turn it into poison. An Ancient said, "If you see
it in phenomena, you'll fall into ordinary feelings; if you go to
your intellect to figure it out, after all you will seek without
finding." Yen T'ou said, "This is the livelihood of a transcen-

Fortieth Case

24 7

dent man; he just reveals the bit before the eyes, just like a
flash of lightning."
Nan Ch'uan's great meaning was like this; he has the capa­
bility to capture rhinos and tigers, to judge dragons and snakes.
When you get here, you must understand on your own: have
you not heard it said, "The single transcending road has not
been transmitted by a thousand sages; students toil over forms
like moneys grasping at reflections." See how Hsueh Tau
brings it out in verse:

VERSE

Seeing, hearing, awareness, knowledge; these are not one and
the sameIn the multitude of forms and myriad appearances, there
is not a single thing. Seven flowers, eight blooms.b Eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are all at once a ham­
merhead without a hole.
Mountains and rivers are not seen in a mirror.

There is no such scenery here where I am. What is long is
of itself long; what is short is of itself short; green is green
and yellow is yellow. Where do you see them?
The frosty sky's moon sets, the night nearly half over;

He has led you into the weeds. The whole world has never
concealed it. I only fear you will go sit inside a ghost cave.
With whom will it cast a shadow, cold in the clear pool!

Is there anyone? Is there? If they did not sleep on the same
bed, how could they know the cover is worn out? Some­
one who is sad should not speak of it to another who is
sad; if he speaks to a sad man, it would sadden him to
death.

though they are dreaming, they are having a good dream. At
first there was talk of 'one body'-here he says that they are

not the same: "Seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowledge are
not one and the same- I Mountains and rivers are not seen in a
mirror." If you say that they are seen in a mirror, and only then
illumined, then they are not apart from where the mirror is.
Mountains, rivers, and the great earth; plants, trees, and forests
-do not use a mirror to observe them. If you use a mirror to
observe, then you make it into two parts. Just let mountains be
mountains and rivers be rivers. "Each thing abides in its nor­
mal state; the mundane aspect always remains."
"Mountains and rivers are not seen in a mirror." Then tell
me, where can you see them? Do you understand? When you
get here, turn towards: "The frosty sky's moon sets, the night
nearly half over"-This Side he has summed up for you; That
Side, you must cross by yourself.
But do you realize that Hsueh Tou uses his own thing to
help others? "With whom will it cast a shadow, cold in the
clear pool?" Do you think he is reflected himself, or do you
think he is reflected together with anyone?c It is necessary to
cut off mental activity and cut off understanding before finally
reaching this realm.
Right now, we don't need a clear pool, and we don't have to
wait for the moon to set in the frosty sky. Right now, how is it?

NOTES

This incident marks the beginning of the 'separate transmission'
of Ch'an: at the assembly on Vulture Peak, the Buddha raised a
flower. No one in the crowd understood his meaning but
Mahakasyapa, who gave a slight smile. Thus Buddha recognized
Mahakasyapa as the heir to the treasury of the eye of the true
teaching.

b.

'Seven flowers, eight blooms' is one literal translation of a phrase
that bears multiple meanings. It can mean profusion, confusion in
multiplicity, 'cracked and shattered.' It can also mean opened up,
clearly distinct, everything revealed in all its multiplicity.

c.

According to the Shudensho, the moon's setting can be inter­
preted as 'descending,' or shining into the pool, casting a reflec­
tion: is it just the moon alone, or is anyone there? The ambiguity
of the subject makes this passage difficult to translate, while the
ambivalence itself underscores the unity of self and world.

when going against and with, vertically and horizontally, even
the Buddhas cannot know. One who is a man detached from
the world, who transcends convention, reveals the abilities of a
great man who stands out from the crowd. He walks on thin
ice, runs on a sword's edge. He is like the unicorn's horn, like a
lotus flower in fire. When he sees someone beyond compari­
son, he knows they are on the same path. Who is an expert? As
a test I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

Chao Chou asked T'ou Tzu, "How is it when a man who has
died the great death returns to life? "1
T'ou Tzu said, "He must not go by night: he must get there

Chao Chou asked T'ou Tzu, "How is it when a man who has

saying, "He must not go by night: he must get there in day­
light." But say, what time and season is this? A flute with no
holes strikes against a felt-pounding board. This is called "a
question to test the host"; it is also called "an intentional
question." All over they praised T'ou Tzu and Chao Chou for
having outstanding eloquence. Though the two old men suc­
ceeded to different masters, observe how their active edges
accord as one.
One day T'ou Tzu spread the tea setting to entertain Chao
Chou. T'ou Tzu himself passed some steamed cakes to Chao
Chou, but Chou paid no attention. T'ou Tzu ordered his atten­
dant to give the sesame cakes to Chao Chou. Chou bowed to
the attendant three times. But say, what was his meaning?
Observe how he always went right to the root to uphold this
fundamental thing for the benefit of others.
There was a monk who asked T'ou Tzu, "What is the Way?"
T'ou Tzu answered, "The Way." The monk asked, "What is
Buddha?" T'ou Tzu answered, "Buddha." Again he asked,
"How is it before the golden lock is open?" T'ou Tzu answered,
"Open." He asked, "How is it before the golden rooster has
crowed?" T'ou Tzu answered, "This sound does not exist."
The monk asked, "How is it after he crows?" T'ou Tzu an­
swered, "Each knows the time for himself." His whole life
T'ou Tzu's questions and answers were all like this.
Look: when Chao Chou asked, "How is it when a man who
has died the great death returns to life?" T'ou Tzu immediately
said, "He must not go by night: he must get there in daylight."
Direct as sparks struck from stone, like the brilliance of a
lightning flash. Only a transcendental man like him could do
this.
A man who has died the great death has no Buddhist doc­
trines and theories, no mysteries and marvels, no gain and loss,
no right and wrong, no long and short. When he gets here, he
just lets it rest this way. An Ancient said of this, "On the level
ground the dead are countless; only one who can pass through
the forest of thorns is a good hand." Yet one must pass beyond
that Other Side too to begin to attain. Even so, for present day
people even to get to this realm is already difficult to achieve.
If you have any leanings or dependence, any interpretative
understanding, then there is no connection. Master Che called

Forty-first Case

251

this "vision that is not purified." My late teacher Wu Tsu
called it "the root of life not cut off." One must die the great
death once, then return to life. Master Yung Kuang of central
Chekiang said, "If you miss at the point of their words, then
you're a thousand miles from home. In fact you must let go
your hands while hanging from a cliff, trust yourself and accept
the experience. Afterwards you return to life again. I can't de­
ceive you-how could anyone hide this extraordinary truth?"
The meaning of Chao Chou's question is like this. T'ou Tzu
is an adept, and he didn't tum his back on what Chao Chou
asked: it's just that he cut off his feelings and left no traces, so
unavoidably he's hard to understand. He just showed the little
bit before the eyes. Thus an Ancient said, "If you want to attain
Intimacy, don't ask with questions. The question is in the an­
swer, and the answer is in the question." It would have been
very difficult for someone other than T'ou Tzu to reply when
questioned by Chao Chou. But since T'ou Tzu is an expert, as
soon as it's raised he knows where it comes down.

VERSE

In life there's an eye-still, it's the same as death.
The two don't know of each other. Back and forth, coming

and going. If Chao Chou wasn't well provided, how could
he discern whether T'ou Tzu was monk or lay?
Why use antiserum to test an adept?

If you don't test how can you discern the truth? Having
met, try to give an examination-what's the harm? I too
want to question him.
Even the Ancient Buddhas, they say, have never arrived.

Luckily they had companions. Even the thousand sages
haven't transmitted it. I don't know either.
I don't know who can scatter dust and sand.

There is quite a bit of this right now. (The dust and sand)
gets in your eyes whether they're opened or closed. When
you bring it up this way, Your Reverence, where does it
come down?

252

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

"In life there's an eye-still, it's the same as death." Hsueh
Tou is a man who knows what is, therefore he can dare to

make up verses. An Ancient said, "He studies the living
phrase; he doesn't study the dead phrase." Hsueh Tou says that
to have eyes within life is still to be just the same as a dead
man. Has he ever died? To have eyes within death is to be the
same as a live man. An Ancient said, "Utterly kill a dead man,
then you will see a live man. Bring a dead man fully to life,
then you will see a dead man."
Though Chao Chou is a live man, he intentionally made up
a dead question to test T'ou Tzu. It was like taking a substance
that vitiates the character of a medicine in order to test him.
That's why Hsueh Tou said, "Why use antiserum to test an
adept?" This versifies Chao Chou's questioning.
Afterwards he praises T'ou Tzu: "Even the Ancient Bud­
dhas, they say, have never arrived." Even the ancient Buddhas
never got to where the man who has died the great death re­
turns to life-nor have the venerable old teachers ever gotten
here. Even old Shakyamuni or the blue-eyed barbarian monk
(Bodhidharma) would have to study again before they get it.
That is why Hsueh Tou said, "I only grant that the old barbar­
ian knows; I don't allow that he understands."
Hsueh Tou says, "I don't know who can scatter dust and
sand." Haven't you heard: a monk asked Ch'ang Ch'ing, "What
is the eye of a man of knowledge?" Ch'ing said, "He has a vow
not to scatter sand." Pao Fu said, "You mustn't scatter any
more of it." All over the country venerable old teachers sit on
carved wood seats, using blows and shouts, raising their
whisks, knocking on the seat, exhibiting spiritual powers and
acting as masters-all of this is scattering sand. But say, how
can this be avoided?

Layman P'ang's Good Snowflakes

Bringing it out unique and alone (is still) dripping with water,

together (it's still like) a silver mountain, an iron wall.
If you describe and discuss, you see ghosts in front of your

citing this old case: look!

CASE

When Layman P'ang took leave of Yao Shan1, Shan ordered ten
Ch'an travellers to escort him to the gate.2 The Layman
pointed to the snow in the air and said, "Good snowflakes­
they don't fall in any other place."3
At the time one of the Ch'an travellers named Ch'uan said,
"Where do they fall?"4 The Layman slapped him once.5 Ch'uan
said, "Even a layman shouldn't be so coarse."6 The Layman
said, "Though you call yourself a Ch'an traveller this way, the
King of Death still won't let you go."7 Ch'uan said, "How
about you, Layman?"8 Again the Layman slapped him9 and
said, "Your eyes see like a blind man, your mouth speaks like a
mute."10
Hsueh Tau said besides, "When P'ang first spoke I just
would have made a snowball and hit him with it."11

this treatment).
3. He stirs up waves where there's no wind. The finger (he points

with) has eyes. There's an echo in this old fellow's words.
4. On target. He comes on following after P'ang. Of course he

climbed onto P'ang's hook.
5. A hit! As it turns out, the thief that Ch'uan pulled in ransacked

his house.
6. Staring eyes inside a coffin.
7. The second ladleful of foul water has been poured over him. Why

only the King of Death? Here I wouldn't let him go either.
8. His coarse mind hasn't changed. Again he's asking for a beating.

From beginning to end this monk is at a loss.
9. Of course. Adding frost on top of snow. Having taken a beating,

reveal the truth.
10. He has another conciliatory statement. Again he reads the verdict

for him.
11. Hsueh Tou is right, but he draws the bow after the thief has gone.

This is still quite indulgent. Nevertheless, I'd like to see their
arrowpoints meet. But what can we do?-Hsueh Tou has· fallen
into the ghost cave.

COMMENTARY

Layman P'ang called on Ma Tsu and Shih T'ou: at both places
he had verses (to express his realization).
When he first saw Shih Tou he asked, "What man doesn't
keep company with the myriad things?" Before he stopped
talking, he had his mouth covered by Shih T'ou and had an
awakening. He made up a verse saying,

My everyday affairs are no different:
Only I myself naturally harmonize.
No place is grasped or rejected,
Nowhere do I go for or against.
Who considers crimson and purple honorable?
The green mountains have not a speck of dust.
Spiritual powers and their wondrous functioning­
Hauling water and carrying firewood.

Forty-second Case

255

Later P'ang called on Ma Tsu. Again he asked, "What man
doesn't keep company with the myriad things?" Tsu said,
"Wait till you can swallow all the water in West River in one
gulp, then I'll tell you." The Layman emptied out in great

enlightenment. He made up a verse saying,
The ten directions, a common gathering­
Everyone studies not-doing.
This is the place where Buddhas are chosen­
Minds empty, they return successful.
Since P'ang was an adept, all the various monasteries later
welcomed him, and wherever he went they vied to praise him.
After he had gotten to Yao Shan and stayed around there quite
a while, he went to take leave of Yao Shan. Shan held him in
the highest esteem, so he ordered ten Ch'an travellers to see
him off. It happened to be snowing at the time: the Layman
pointed to the snow and said, "Good snowflakes-they don't
fall in any other place."
When Ch'an traveller Ch'uan asked, "Where do they fall?"
the Layman immediately slapped him. Since Ch'uan was un­
able to carry out the order, the Layman ordered him to carry
out half. Although the order was put into effect, when Ch'an
traveller Ch'uan responded in this way, it was not that he
didn't know what P'ang was getting at. They each had a point
to their activity, but their rolling up and rolling out were not
the same. Even so, in some respects he didn't come up to the
Layman. That is why he fell into his trap and found it difficult
to get out of the Layman's range.
After the Layman had hit him, the Layman went on to ex­
plain the reason to him saying, "Your eyes see like a blind man,
your mouth speaks like a mute." Besides the previous words
Hsueh Tou said, "When he first spoke I just would have made a
snowball and hit him with it." Hsueh Tou talked this way, not
wanting to turn his back on the question: it's just that his
action was tardy. Librarian Ch'ing said, "The Layman's mind is
like a lightning bolt. If we waited for you to grab a snowball,
how long would it take? Only if you hit him while he's still
speaking can you cut him off completely."
Hsueh Tou versifies his own hitting and says:

256

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
VERSE

The snowball hits! The snowball hits!
What will he do about falling into a secondary action? It's
not worth the trouble to bring it forth. Overhead vastness,
underfoot vastness.
Old Pang's ability cannot grasp it.
Again and again there are people who don't know this. I
only fear it's not so.
Gods and humans do not know for themselves:
What scene is this? Does Hsueh Tou know?
In eyes, in ears, absolutely clean.
The arrowpoints meet. Your eyes see like a blind man,
your mouth speaks like a mute.
Absolutely cleanHow? Where will you see Layman P'ang and Hsueh Tou?
Even the blue-eyed barbarian monk Bodhidharma would find
it hard to discriminate.
Bodhidharma comes forth: what does he say to you? I'll
hit saying, "What are you saying?" They're buried in the
same pit.

COMMENTARY

"The snowball hits! The snowball hits! I Old P'ang's ability
cannot grasp it." Hsueh Tou wanted to walk on the Layman's
head. The Ancients used "snow" to illustrate the matter of
Uniformity. Hsueh Tou meant: "If at that time I had made a
snowball and hit him with it, no matter what abilities the
Layman had, it would have been hard for him to reach (me.)"
Hsueh Tou praises his own hitting, far from knowing where
he's lost his profit.
"Gods and men do not know for themselves: I In eyes, in
ears, absolutely clean." In the eyes is snow, in the ears is snow
too-just at that moment they are dwelling in Uniformity.
This is also called "the realm of Samantabhadra." The
phenomenon of Uniformity is also called "becoming solid."

Forty-second Case

25 7

Yun Men said, "Even 'having not the slightest worry in the
world' is still a turning phrase." When you don't see a single
form, this finally is half the issue. If you want the whole issue,
first you must know that there is a single road going beyond;
when you get here your great function must become manifest
(with no gap) for even a needle to enter, and you don't accept
the judgments of other people.
Thus it was said, "He studies the living phrase; he doesn't
study the dead phrase." An Ancient said, "An appropriate
statement is a stake at which to tether a donkey for ten
thousand eons." What's the use?
When he gets to this point Hsueh Tau has finished the verse.
But he turns around again and says, "But this cleanness is
absolute-even Bodhidhanna would find it hard to discrimi­
nate." Since even Bodhidhanna finds it hard to discern, what
more would you have me say?

FORTY-THIRD CASE

Tung Shan's No Cold or Heat

POINTER

Ten thousand ages abide by the phrase that determines heaven
and earth. Even the thousand sages cannot judge the ability to
capture tigers and rhinos. Without any further traces of
obstruction, the whole being appears everywhere equally.
If you want to understand the hammer and tongs of tran­
scendence, you need the forge and bellows of an adept.
But say, since ancient times has there ever been such a fam­
ily style or not? To test I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

A monk asked Tung Shan, "When cold and heat come, how can

we avoid them?"1
Shan said, "Why don't you g o to the place where there is no
cold or heat?"2
The monk said, "What is the place where there is no cold or

Forty-third Case

259

is indeed an occasion to be sad. Tung Shan overturns the great
ocean and kicks over Mt. Sumem. But say, where is Tung Shan?

COMMENTARY

Master Hsin of Huang Lung picked this out and said, "Tung
Shan puts the collar on the sleeve and cuts off the shirtfront
under the armpits. But what could he do?-This monk didn't
like it." Right then a monk came forward and asked Huang
Lung, "How are they to be dealt with?" After a long silence
Huang Lung said, "Peaceful meditation does not require moun­
tains and rivers: when you have extinguished the mind, fire
itself is cool."
Tell me all of you, where is Tung Shan's trap at? If you can
clearly discern this, for the first time you will know how the
five positions of the Tung Shan tradition of interchanging cor­
rect and biaseda handle people in an extraordinary way. When
you reach this transcendental realm, then you'll be able to be
like this without needing any arrangements, and you'll spon­
taneously accord perfectly.
Thus it is said:
The biased within the correct:
In the middle of the first night, before the moon
shines,
No wonder, when they meet, they don't recognize
each other:
Each is hidden, still embracing the aversion of
former days.
The correct within the biased:
At dawn an old woman encounters an ancient mirror;
Clearly she sees her face-there is no other reality.
Don't go on mistaking the image for the head.
Coming from within the correct:
Within nothingness there's a road out of the dust.
If you can just avoid violating the present taboo
name,
You'll still surpass the eloquent ones of former
dynasties who silenced every tongue.

260

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Arrival within the biased:
When two swords cross points, there's no need to
withdraw.
A good hand is like a lotus in fireClearly he naturally has the energy to reach the
heavens.
Arrival within both at once:
He does not fall into being or non-being-who dares
to associate with him!
Everyone wants to get out of the ordinary flow,
But after all he returns and sits in the ashes.
Jurist Yuan of Fu Shan considers this case as being in the pat­
tern of the five positions. If you understand one, then the rest
are naturally easy to understand. Yen T'ou said, "It's like a
gourd (floating) on the water: push it, and it rolls over without
making any effort at all."
Once there was a monk who asked Tung Shan, "How is it
when Manjusri and Samantabhadra come to call?" Shan said,
"I'd drive them into a herd of water buffalo." The monk said,
"Teacher, you enter hell fast as an arrow." Shan said, "I've got
all their strength."
When Tung Shan said, "Why don't you go to the place where
there is no cold or heat?" this was the correct within the
biased. When the monk said, "What is the place where there is
no cold or heat?" and Shan said, "When it's cold the cold kills
you; when it's hot the heat kills you," this was the biased
within the correct. Though it's correct, still it's biased; though
it's biased, nevertheless it's complete. This is recorded in full
detail in the Records of the Ts'ao Tung School. Had it been the
Lin Chi tradition, there wouldn't have been so many things.
With this kind of public case you must understand directly as
soon as it is uttered.
Some say, "I like no cold no heat very much." What grasp do
they have on the case? An Ancient said, "If you run on a
sword's edge, you're fast. If you see with emotional conscious­
ness, then you're slow."
Haven't you heard: A monk asked Ts'ui Wei, "What is the
meaning of the Patriarch coming from the West?" Wei said,
"When no one comes, I'll tell you," then went into the garden.
The monk said, "There's no one right here: please, Teacher,
tell me." Wei pointed to the bamboo and said, "This stalk is so

Forty-third Case

261

tall, that stalk is so short." Suddenly the monk was greatly
enlightened.
Again: Ts'ao Shan asked a monk, "When it's so hot, where
will you go to avoid it?" The monk said, "I'll avoid it inside a
boiling cauldron, within the coals of a furnace." Ts'ao Shan
said, "How can it be avoided in a boiling cauldron or among the
coals of a furnace?" The monk said, "The multitude of suffer­
ings cannot reach there." See how the people of the Ts'ao Tung
house naturally understood the conversation of people of their
house.
Hsueh Tau uses the affairs of their house to produce his
verse:

VERSE

He lets down his hand, but still it's the same as a ten
thousand fathom cliff:
Who can discern this without being an adept? Where are
correct and biased not perfectly merged? Once the impe­
rial edict is on its way the nobles get out of the road (to let
it pass).
Why must correct and biased be in an arrangemenU
If you do arrange them, where will you have Today? How
will you not become involved in dualism? When the wind
moves, the grasses bend down; where the water runs,

streams form.
The ancient crystal palace reflects the bright moon,
Round and full. Just don't grasp the reflection, and don't
run right in.
The sly hound of Han vainly runs up the stairs.
It isn't just this time. He's stumbled past. Why is he run­
ning after dirt? I'll hit and say you are a fellow student of
this monk.

COMMENTARY

In the Ts'ao Tung tradition there is appearing in the world and
not appearing in the world; there is letting down a hand and
not letting down a hand. If you don't appear in the world, your

262

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

eyes gaze at cloudy skies. If you appear in the world, then your
head and face are covered with ashes and dirt.
"Eyes gazing at cloudy skies" is '1on top of a ten thousand
fathom peak." 11Head and face covered with ashes and dirt"
refers to the business of letting down a hand. Sometimes "head
and face covered with ashes and dirt" is 110n top of a ten
thousand fathom peak." Sometimes 110n top of a ten thousand
fathom peak" is "head and faces covered with ashes and dirt."
In reality, going into inhabited areas to let down a hand and
standing alone on a solitary peak are the same. Having returned
to the source and comprehended nature, it is no different from
discriminating intelligence. You must avoid understanding
them as two parts.
Thus Hsueh Tau said, "He lets down his hand, but still it's
the same as a ten thousand fathom cliff." There's simply no
place for you to approach. "Why must correct and biased be in
an arrangement?" When it comes time to function1 they are
naturally like this, they are not in any arrangement. This
praises Tung Shan's answer.
Afterwards he said, 1The ancient crystal palace reflects the
bright moon I The sly hound of Han vainly runs up the stairs."
This just versifies this monk running after Tung Shan's words.
In the Ts'ao Tung tradition they have "the stone woman," 11the
wooden horse," "the bottomless basket," "the pearl that
shines (of itself) at night," "the dead snake," and so on1 eight­
een kinds. Their general purpose is to illustrate the position of

the correct.
When Tung Shan answered, 11Why not go to where there is
no cold or heat?" this was like the moon shining in the ancient
crystal palace, seeming to have a round reflection. The monk

asked, "What is the place where there is no cold or heat? 1' This

is just like the hound of Han chasing a clod of dirt: he runs
frantically up the stairs to catch the moon's reflection. Tung
Shan said, 11When it 1S cold, the cold kills you; when it's hot,
the heat kills you." This monk was like the hound of Han
running up the stairs but not seeing the image of the moon.
11The hound of Han" comes out of Essays on the Warring
States where it says, "He was a swift black dog belonging to the
Han clan. The rabbits in the mountains were clever; only he
could catch these rabbits." Hsueh Tau draws on this to make a
comparison for this monk.

Forty-fourth Case

265

COMMENTARY

Ho Shan imparted some words saying, "Cultivating study is
called 'learning.' Cutting off study is called 'nearness.' Going
beyond these two is to be considered real going beyond." The
words of this case come from the Jewel Treasure Treatise. To
study till there is nothing to study is called "cutting off study."
Thus it is said, "Shallow learning, deep enlightenment; deep
learning, no enlightenment." This is called "cutting off study."
Yung Chia, who was enlightened in one night at Ts'ao Ch'i,
said, "Years ago I accumulated learning, consulted the com­
mentaries, and searched scriptures and treatises. Once one's
cultivation of studies is completed and exhausted, he is called a
non-doing, free man of the Path, beyond study. When he
reaches the point of cutting off study, only then for the first
time is he near to the Path. When he manages to go beyond
these two (aspects of) study, this is called'real going beyond.'"
The monk too was undeniably bright and quick, so he
picked up on these words to question Ho Shan. Shan said,
"Knowing how to beat the drum." This is what is called flavor­
less words, flavorless speech. If you want to understand this
case, you must be a transcendent man. Only then will you see
that these words have nothing to do with inherent nature, nor
is there anything about them to discuss. Understand directly
like the bottom falling out of a bucket: only this is where a
patchrobed monk rests easy and begins to be able to accord
with the meaning of the Patriarch coming from the West. Thus
Yun Men said, "Hsueh Feng's rolling a ball, Ho Shan's beating
the drum, the National Teacher's bowl of water, Chao Chou's
'Drink some tea,'-all these are indications of the absolute."
Again the monk asked, "What is the real truth?" Shan said,
"Knowing how to beat the drum." In the real truth not one
other thing is set up. As for the worldly truth, the myriad
things are all present. That there is no duality to real and con­
ventional is the highest meaning of the holy truths.
Again the monk asked, "'Mind is Buddha'-I'm not asking
about this. What is not mind and not Buddha?" Shan said,
"Knowing how to beat the drum." "What's mind is Buddha" is
easy to seek. But when you get to that which is not mind and
not Buddha, it's hard and there are few people who arrive.
Again the monk asked, "When a transcendent man comes,
how do you receive him?" Shan said, "Knowing how to beat

the drum." A transcendent man is a man who has passed
through, who is free, purified, and at ease.
All over they consider these four phases as a message from
the source: they are called Ho Shan's four beating the drums.
This is just like the following:
A monk asked Ching Ch'ing, "At the beginning of a new
year, is there any Buddha Dharma or not?" Ch'ing said, "There
is." The monk said, "What is the Buddha Dharma at the begin­
ning of a new year?" Ch'ing said, "Initiate good fortune on new
year's day and the myriad things are all renewed." The monk
said, "I thank the Master for the answer." Ch'ing said, "Today I
lost the advantage." He had six kinds of losses like this answer.
Again: A monk asked the great teacher Ching Kuo, "How is
it when a crane perches upon a lone pine?" Kuo said, "Beneath
its feet, an embarrassing situation." He also asked, "How is it
when snow covers the thousand mountains?" Kuo said, "After
the sun comes out, an embarrassing situation." Again the
monk asked, "Where did the spirits who protect the Teaching
go during the purge of 845?" Kuo said, "For the two guardians
outside the triple gate, an embarrassing situation." All over,
these are called Ching Kuo's three embarrassments.
Again: Pao Fu asked a monk, "What Buddha is the one in the
temple?" The monk said, "Try to decide for sure, Teacher." Fu
said, "It's old Shakyamuni." The monk said, "Better not de­
ceive people." Fu said, "On the contrary, it's you who are de­
ceiving me." Fu also asked the monk, "What's your name?"
The monk said, "Hsien Tse." (which means "all wet") Fu said,
"How is it when you encounter withering dryness?" The monk
said, "Who is the withering dry one?" Fu said, "I am." The
monk said, "Better not deceive people, Teacher." Fu said, "On
the contrary, it's you who are deceiving me." Again Fu asked
the monk, "What work do you do that you eat till you're so
big?" The monk said, "You're not so small yourself, Teacher."
Fu made a crouching gesture. The monk said, "Better not de­
ceive people, Teacher." Fu said, "On the contrary, it's you who
are deceiving me." Fu also asked the bath keeper, "How wide is
that cauldron (you heat the water in)?" The bath keeper aid,
"Please, Teacher, measure and see." Fu went through the mo­
tions of measuring. The bath keeper said, "Better not deceive
people, Teacher." Fu said, "On the contrary, it's you who are
deceiving me." All over they call this Pao Fu's four deceptions
of people.

Forty-fourth Case

267

This main case is also like Hsueh Feng's four tubs of lac­
quer:3 all were masters of our ancient sect. Each produces pro­
found and marvelous teachings and devices to receive people.
Afterwords Hsueh Tou draws out a single continuous line
based on Yun Men's teachings to his assembly, and versifies
this public case.

VERSE

One hauls rock;
In the heart of the realm the emperor commands. A leper
drags along his companions. A transcendent man comes
this way.
A second moves earth.
Outside the passes the general gives orders. Both have
their crimes covered by the same indictment. Those with
the same disease sympathize with each other.
To shoot the bolt requires a ten-ton crossbow.
Even if it's got a ten-ton pull, it still won't be able to
penetrate. It should not be used against light opposition;
how could it be used for a dead frog?
The old master of Elephant Bone Cliff (Hsueh Feng) rolled
ballsThere's another man who has come this way. He had an
iron hammer head with no handle hole. Who doesn't
know?
How could this equal Ho Shan's "Knowing how to beat the
drum"?
An iron spike. It takes this old fellow to understand. One
son has attained intimately.
I report for you to know:
Even Hsueh Tou hasn't seen it in dreams. He's adding
frost on top of snow. Do you know?
Don't be careless!
Again there's a bit of utter confusion.
The sweet is sweet, the bitter is bitter.
Thanks for the answer. Hsueh Tou wrongly adds a foot­
note: he should be given thirty blows. Has he ever taken a
beating? As before, dark vastness. I'll hit!

268

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

One day Kuei Tsung gave the general call to labor (summoning
everyone) to haul rock. Tsung asked the Duty Distributor
where he was going. The Duty Distributor said, "I'm going to
haul rock." Tsung said, "For now I'll let you haul rock, but
don't move the tree in the middle."
Whenever a newcomer arrived (at his place) Mu P'ing would
first order him to move three loads of earth. Mu P'ing had a
verse which he showed to his assembly saying:
East Mountain Road is narrow, West Mountain is
low:
New comers must not refuse three loads of mud.
Alas, you've been traversing the roads so long,
It's so clear, but you don't recognize it and instead
get lost.

Later there was a monk who asked Mu P'ing, "I don't ask about
what is included in the three loads. What about what's outside
the three loads?" P'ing said, "The Iron Wheel Emperor com­
mands in his realm." The monk was speechless, so P'ing hit
him.
This is why Hsueh Tou said, "One hauls rock I A second
moves earth."
"To shoot the bolt requires a ten-ton crossbow." Hsueh Tou
uses the ten-ton pull crossbow to explain this case: he wants
you to see how Ho Shan helped people. If it's a monstrous
dragon or tiger or some other fierce beast, then you use this
crossbow. If it's a tiny bird or a creature of little consequence,
of course you mustn't use the crossbow lightly. Hence a ten­
ton crossbow does not shoot its bolt for a rat.
"The old master of Elephant Bone Cliff rolled balls." That is:
one day Hsueh Feng saw Hsuan Sha corning and rolled out
three wooden balls together. Hsuan Sha made a smashing ges­
ture. Hsueh Feng profoundly approved of him.
Although all of these stories are instances of the great func­
tioning of their entire capacities, none equal's Ho Shan's
"Knowing how to beat the drum." How direct this is-but it's
hard to understand. Thus Hsueh Tou said, "How could this
equal Ho Shan's 'Knowing how to beat the drum'?"
Again he feared that people would just make their living on
the words without knowing their source, (and thus be) careless.

Forty-fourth Case

269

Therefore he said, "I report for you to know: don't be careless!"
You too must really get to this realm before you can under­
stand. If you don't want to carelessly confuse things, "The
sweet is sweet, the bitter is bitter." Though Hsueh Tou picked
it up and played with it like this, in the end he can't leap clear
of Ho Shan either.

"Hsueh Feng's four tubs of lacquer" refers to some incidents be­
tween Hsueh Feng and T'ou Tzu, recorded in the Record of the

Transmission of the Lamp:
Hsueh Feng was attending on T'ou Tzu, who pointed to a
piece of rock in front of his hut and said to Hsueh Feng, "All the
Buddhas of past, present, and future are right here." Feng said,
"One must know that there is one who is not here." T'ou Tzu
then returned to his hut to sit, saying, "You dull tub of lacquer!"
Feng followed T'ou Tzu to call on the hermit of Lung Yen.
Feng asked, "Where does the road of Lung Yen go to?" T'ou Tzu
took his staff and pointed before them. Feng said, "Does it go east
or go west?" T'ou Tzu said, "You tub of lacquer!"
Another day Feng asked, "How is it when 'immediately
completed with a single stroke'?" T'ou Tzu said, "It's not some­
one of unsettled temperament." Feng said, "How is it when not
using a single stroke?" T'ou Tzu said, "You tub of lacquer!"
One day when T'ou Tzu was in his hut sitting, Feng asked,
"Master, is there anyone who comes here to study or not?" T'ou
Tzu took a hoe from under his bed and threw it down in front of
him. Feng said, "If so, then I'll dig right here." T'ou Tzu said,
"This tub of lacquer is not quick."

FORTY-FIFTH CASE

Chao Chou's Seven-Pound Cloth
Shirt

POINTER

When he must speak, he speaks-in the whole world there is
no match for him. When he should act, he acts-his whole
capacity doesn't defer (to anyone). He is like sparks struck from
stone, like the brilliance of a flash of lightning, like a raging fire
fanned by the wind, like a rushing torrent crossing a sword
edge. When he lifts up the hammer and tongs of transcendence,
you won't avoid losing your point and having your tongue tied.
He lets out a single continuous road. To test I'm citing it:
look!

CASE

A monk asked Chao Chou, "The myriad things return to one.

Where does the one return to?"1
Chou said, "When I was in Ch'ing Chou I made a cloth shirt.
It weighed seven pounds."2

NOTES

1.

He's pressing this old fellow. Piled in mountains, heaped up in
ranges. He should avoid going to the ghost cave to make his liv­
ing.

2.

After all Chou goes in all directions, drawing a net that fills the
sky. But do you see Chao Chou? He has picked up the nostrils of
patchrobed monks.

COMMENTARY

If you understand "going immediately at one stroke," then

you've pierced the nostrils of the world's old teachers all at

once, and they can't do a thing about you. Naturally where
water goes, a channel forms. But if you vacillate and hesitate,
the old monk Chao Chou is under your feet. The essential
point of the Buddhist Teaching is not a matter of many words
or verbose speech.
A monk asked Chao Chou, "The myriad things return to
one. Where does the one return to?" Yet Chou answered him
saying, "When I was in Ch'ing Chou I made a cloth shirt; it
weighed seven pounds." If you go to the words to discriminate
you are mistakenly abiding by the zero point of a scale. If you
don't go to the words to discriminate, what can you do about it
that he did nevertheless speak this way? This case, though hard
to see, is nevertheless easy to understand; though easy to un­
derstand, it's still hard to see. Insofar as it's hard, it's a silver
mountain, an iron wall. Insofar as it's easy, you are directly
aware. There's no place for your calculations of right and
wrong.
This story is the same kind as the story of P'u Hua saying,
"Tomorrow there's a feast at the Temple of Great Compas­
sion."3
One day a monk asked Chao Chou, "What is the meaning of
the Patriarch coming from the West?" Chou said, "The cypress
tree in the garden." The monk said, "Don't use objects to teach
people with, Teacher." Chou said, "I've never used objects to
teach people." Observe how, at the ultimate point, where it is
impossible to tum, he does turn, and spontaneously covers
heaven and earth. If you can't turn, wherever you set foot on
the road you get stuck.
But say, did Chao Chou ever have discussions of Buddhist
doctrine or not? If you say he did, when has he ever spoken of
mind or of nature, of mysteries or of marvels? If you say he
didn't have the source meaning of the Buddhist Teaching,
when has he ever turned his back on anyone's question?
Haven't you heard: a monk asked Mu P'ing, "What is the
great meaning of the Buddhist Teaching?" P'ing said, "This
winter melon is so big." Again: a monk asked an ancient
worthy, "Deep in the mountains on an overhanging cliff, in a
remote, inaccessible, uninhabited place, is there any Buddhist
Teaching or not?" The ancient worthy said, "There is." The
monk said, "What is the Buddhist Teaching deep within the
mountains?" The ancient worthy said, "The large rocks are
large, the small ones small."

272

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

When you look at such a case, where are the obscurities?
Hsueh Tau knows what they come down to: thus he opens up a
road of meaning and comes out with a verse for you:

VERSE

He wraps everything up and presses again st the ancient old
awl.
What's the need to press this old fellow? They push and

push back-to where?
How many people k now the weight of the seven-pound shirt!

To bring it out again is not worth half a cent. All I can do
is frown. Still, Chou has done the monk one better.
Right now I throw it down into West Lake;

Only with the ability of Hsueh Tau could this be done. I
don't want it either.
The pure wind of unburdening-to whom should it be imparted?
From the past through the present. Tell me, is Hsueh Tau

harmonizing with Chao Chou, or is he putting down
footnotes for him? One son attains intimately.

COMMENTARY

Of Fen Yang's eighteen kinds of questions, this one in the Case
is called a "wrapping-up question." Hsueh Tau says, "He
wraps everything up and presses against the ancient old awl."
He wraps up everything and makes it return to unity.
This monk wanted to press Chao Chou, but Chou too was
an adept. Where it was impossible to tum, he had a way to
show himself: daring to open his big mouth he immediately
said, "When I was in Ch'ing Chou I made a cloth shirt that
weighed seven pounds." Hsueh Tau says, "How many people
can there be who know the weight of this seven-pound shirt?"
"Right now I throw it down into West Lake." Myriad things
return to one, but he doesn't even need the one. Since he
doesn't need the seven-pound cloth shirt either, all at once he

Forty-fifth Case

273

throws it down into West Lake. When Hsueh Tau dwelt on
Tung T'ing's green peak, there was a West Lake (nearby).
"The pure wind of unburdening-to whom should it be im­
parted?" This refers to Chao Chou teaching his assembly, say­
ing, "If you're coming north I'll load up for you. If you're com­
ing south I'll unload for you. Even if you're corning from Hsueh
Feng or Yun Chu, you're still a fellow carrying a board." Hsueh
Tau says, "To whom should a pure wind like this be im­
parted?" "Loading up" means speaking for you of mind and
nature, of mysteries and marvels-all sorts of expedient
methods. If it's unloaded, there are no longer so many mean­
ings and hidden wonders.
Some people carried a load of Ch'an to Chao Chou's place,
but when they got there they couldn't make use of it at all. He
would set them straight all at once, making them free and easy,
without the slightest concern. We say of this, "After awaken­
ing it's the same as before awakening."
People these days all make unconcern an understanding.
Some say, "There is no delusion or enlightenment: it's not
necessary to go on seeking. Even before the Buddha appeared in
the world, before Bodhidharma ever came to this country, it
could not have been otherwise. What's the use of the Buddha
appearing in the world? What did the Patriarch still come from
the West for?" All such views-what relevance do they have?
You must have greatly penetrated and greatly awakened: then
as before, mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers, in fact all
the myriad things are perfectly manifest. Then for the first
time you can be an unconcerned person.
Haven't you heard Lung Ya say:
To study the Path, first you must have a basis of
enlightenment:
It's like having vied in a boat race:
Though you relax on idle ground as before,
Only having won can you rest.
As for this story of Chao Chou's seven-pound cloth shirt,
look how this man of old talks this way, like gold and jade. Me
talking like this, you listening like this-all of this is "loading
up." But say, what is unloading? Go back to your places and
look into this.

The story is told as follows in the Ch'uan Teng Lun 10:
When (his master) P' an Shan died, P'u Hua carried on his
teaching in the north, sometimes in city markets, sometimes in
isolated villages. He would ring his bell and say, "I hit whether
you're coming from light or coming from darkness."
One day Lin Chi sent a monk to catch him by saying, "How
is it when neither light nor dark?" P'u Hua answered, '1Tomorrow
there's a feast at the Temple of Great Compassion."

FORTY-SIXTH CASE

Ching Ch'ing's Sound of Raindrops

POINTER

With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordi­
nary and holy. His slightest word can break things up, untying
what is bound and releasing what is stuck. As if walking on
thin ice or running over sword blades, he sits within the heaps
of sound and form, he walks on top of sound and form.
For the moment I leave aside wondrous functioning in all
directions. How is it when he leaves that very instant? To test
I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

Ching Ch'ing asked a monk, "What sound is that outside the
gate?"1 The monk said, "The sound of raindrops."2
Ch'ing said, "Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things."3
The monk said, "What about you, Teacher? "4
Ch'ing said, "I almost don't lose mysel£."5
The monk said, "What is the meaning of 'I almost don't lose
myself'? "6
Ch'ing said, "Though it still should be easy to express one­
self, to say the whole thing has to be difficult."7

NOTES

1.

He casually lets down a hook. He doesn't suffer from deafness:
what is he asking?

2.

He's undeniably truthful. It's good news too.

3.

A concern is born. Ch'ing is used to getting his way. He rakes the
monk in. He depends on his own abilities.

4.

As it turns out the monk suffers a defeat. He's turned the spear
around: inevitably it will be hard for Ch'ing to stand up to it.

275

276

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Instead (of Ch'ing, the monk) grabs the spear and stabs the man
back.
5.

Bah! He just can't explain.

6.

He presses this old fellow and crushes the man. His first arrow
was still light, the second arrow was deep.

7.

Provisions to nourish a son. Although it's like this, where have Te
Shan and Lin Chi gone? If he doesn't call it the sound of raindrops,
what sound should he call it? It simply can't be explained.

COMMENTARY

You too should understand right here. When the Ancients im­
parted their teaching, with one device, one object, they wanted
to guide people. One day Ching Ch'ing asked a monk, "What is
that sound outside the gate?" The monk said, "The sound of
quail." Ch'ing said, "If you wish to avoid uninterrupted hell,
don't slander the Wheel of the True Dharma of the Tathagata."
Another time Ch'ing asked, "What is that sound outside the
gate?" A monk said, "The sound of a snake eating a frog."
Ch'ing said, "I knew that sentient beings suffer: here is another
suffering sentient being." These words are the same as the
Case. If patchrobed monks can penetrate here, nothing can
block their independence within the heaps of sound and form.
If you can't penetrate then you are constrained by sound and
form.
In various places they call this "tempering words." If it were
tempering, it would only amount to mental activity. (Those
with this view) do not see where the ancient man Ching Ch'ing
helped people. ( Ch'ing's words in the Case) are also called
"penetrating sound and form," "explaining the eye of the
Path," "explaining sound and form," "explaining the mind
source," "explaining forgetting feelings," "explaining preach­
ing." Though (such interpretations) are undeniably detailed,
nevertheless they still are stuck in cliches.
When Ch'ing asked this way, "What is that sound outside
the gate?" the monk said, "The sound of raindrops." But then
Ch'ing said, "Sentient beings are inverted. They lose them­
selves and follow after things." People all misunderstand and
call this intentionally upsetting the man, but this has nothing
to do with it. How little they realize that Ch'ing has the skill to

Forty-sixth Case

2 77

help people. Ch'ing is so brave he isn't bound by a single device
and a single object. Above all he doesn't spare his eyebrows.
How could Ching Ch'ing not have known that it was the
sound of raindrops? Why was it still worth asking? You must
realize that the Ancient was using his probing pole and reed
shade (to see into the depths) to examine this monk. The monk
too pressed back well, immediately saying, "What about you,
Teacher?" What happened then was that Ching Ch'ing went
into the mud and water to say to him, "I almost don't lose
myself." The reason (for saying this) was that the monk was
losing himself, pursuing things. Why did Ching Ch'ing lose
himself too? You must realize that Ch'ing had a place to get
out himself within the phrase he used to test the monk.
This monk was very dull-he wanted to beat this statement
into the ground, so he asked, "What is the meaning of 'I almost
don't lose myself'?" If it had been the school of Te Shan or Lin
Chi the blows and shouts would already have been falling. But
Ching Ch'ing put through a single continuous path and fol­
lowed him creating complications: he went on to say more to
him, "Though it still should be easy to express oneself, to say
the whole thing has to be difficult." Nevertheless, as an An­
cient said, "Continuity is indeed very difficult." Ching Ch'ing
illuminated for this monk the great affair under his feet.
Hsueh Tau's verse says:
VERSE

An empty hall, the sound of raindrops...
Never ever interrupted. Everyone is here.
Hard to respond, even for an adept.
Of course he doesn't know how. I have never been an
adept. There's provisional and real, there's letting go and
gathering in, there's killing and bringing to life, there's
catching and releasing.
If you say he's ever let the streams enter,
You stick your head into a bowl of glue. If you don't call it
the sound of raindrops, what sound will you call it?
As before you still don't understand.
How often I've asked you! You tubs of lacquer! Give me
back my holeless iron hammer.

278

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Understanding or not understandingCut off the two ends. The two are not separate. It's not on
these two sides.
On South Mountain, on North Mountain, more and more
downpour.
Above our heads and under our feet. If you call it the
sound of raindrops, you're blind. If you don't call it the
sound of raindrops, what sound will you call it? Your feet
must be treading the ground of reality before you can get
here.

COMMENTARY

"An empty hall, the sound of raindrops I Hard to respond, even
for an adept." If you call it the sound of raindrops, then this is
"losing oneself, following after things." If you don't call it the
sound of raindrops, then how will you tum things around? At
this point even if you're an adept, it's still hard to respond.
Therefore an Ancient said, "If your view equals your teacher's,
you have less than half the teacher's merit. Only if your view
goes beyond your teacher's are you fit to receive and carry on
the transmission." And as Nan Yuan said, "With acceptance of
birthlessness under the cudgel, he faces situations without de­
ferring to a teacher."
"If you say he ever let the streams enter, I As before you still
don't understand." In the Surangama Sutra it says, "First, in
the midst of hearing, ( Avalokitesvara ) let the streams enter, but
was mindless of what was there. Since what he let in was
quiescent, the two forms, motion and stillness, were ulti­
mately not produced." If you say it's the sound of raindrops, it's
not right, and if you say it's not the sound of raindrops, it's not
right either. If you say he lets the streams of sound and form
enter, that's not right either. If you call it sound and form, as
before you don't understand his meaning. It is compared to
pointing at the moon with one's finger: the moon is not the
finger.
Understanding and not understanding, "On South Moun­
tain, on North Mountain, more and more downpour."

Ynn Men's Six Do Not Take It In

POINTER

What does the sky say? The four seasons go on there. What
does the earth say? The myriad things are born there. Where
the four seasons go on, he can see the essencei where the
myriad things are born, he can see the action.
But say, where can you see a patchrobed monk? Having
abandoned words and speech and active functioning, having
blocked off your throat when walking, standing, sitting, and
lying down-can you still discern him?

CASE

A monk asked Yun Men, "What is the Body of Reality?"1a Men
said, "Six do not take it in."2

NOTES

1.

So many people have doubts about this. The thousand sages can't
leap out of it. He's indulged quite a bit.

2.

He cuts nails and shears through iron. "An eight-comer mortar
flies through the air." The spirit tortoise is dragging his tail.

COMMENTARY

Yun Men said, "Six do not take it in." This is indeed hard to
understand: even if you reach it before the first indications are
distinct, this is already the secondary. If you understand after
the first indications arise, then you've fallen into the tertiary. If
you go to the words and phrases to discern (his meaning), you
will search without ever being able to find it.
But ultimately, what do you take as the Body of Reality?
Those who are adepts immediately get up and go as soon as

279

280

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

they hear it raised. If on the other hand you linger in thought
and hold back your potential, you should listen humbly to this
treatment.
The senior monk Fu of T'ai Yuan was originally a lecturer.
One day when he had gone up to his seat to lecture, he spoke of
the Body of Reality saying, "Vertically it reaches through the
three times, and horizontally it extends through the ten direc­
tions." There was a Ch'an traveller in the audience who let out
a laugh as he heard this. Fu came down from his seat and said,
"What was my shortcoming just now? Please, Ch'an man, ex­
plain so I can see." The Ch'an man said, "Lecturer, you only
lecture on that which pertains to the extent of the Body of
Reality-you don't see the Body of Reality." Fu said, "After all,
what would be right?" The Ch'an man said, "You should tem­
porarily stop lecturing and sit in a quiet room. You have to see
it for yourself."
Fu did as he said and sat quietly all night. Suddenly he heard
them hitting the bell for the fifth watch: suddenly he was
greatly enlightened. So he went and knocked on the Ch'an
man's door saying, "I've understood." The Ch'an man said,
"Try to say something so I can see." Fu said, "From today
onwards I'll no longer twist these nostrils born of my parents."
Again: in the scriptures it says, "The Buddha's true Body of
Reality is like empty space. It manifests shapes in response to
things like the moon (reflected) in the water."
Again: a monk asked Chia Shan, "What is the Body of Real­
ity?" Shan said, "The Body of Reality has no form." The monk
asked, "What is the Eye of Reality?" Shan said, "The Eye of
Reality has no flaws."
Yun Men said, "Six do not take it in." Some say of this case,
"This is just the six sense-organs, the six sense-objects, the six
consciousnesses. These sixes all arise from the Body of Reality,
so the six faculties cannot take it in." Intellectual interpreta­
tions such as this, though, are irrelevant. Moreover, they drag
down Yun Men. If you want to see, then see: there's no place
for your attempts to rationalize. Haven't you seen how it says
in the scripture: "This Truth is not something that calculating
thought and discrimination can understand."
Yun Men's answers have often provoked people's intellec­
tual interpretations. Thus in every phrase of Yun Men's there
are inevitably three phrases present. Nor does he turn his back

Forty-seventh Case

281

on your questions: responding to the time, adapting to the
season, with one word, one phrase, one dot, one line, he indeed
has a place to show himself. Thus it is said, 11When a single
phrase is penetrated, a thousand phrases, ten thousand phrases,
are penetrated all at once."
But say, is 11Six do not take it in" the Body of Reality? Is it
the Patriarchs? I give you thirty blows!
Hsueh Tau's verse says:

VERSE

One, two, three, four, five, six-

Go all the way through, then start again at the beginning.
For every drop of water, a drop of ice. Why expend so
much effort?
The blue-eyed barbarian monk can't count up to it.
Past, present, and future lives for sixty eons. Have you

ever seen Bodhidharma even in a dream? Why do you
deliberately transgress?
Shao Lin deceptively said he passed it on to Shen Kuang­

When one man transmits a falsehood, ten thousand

Where is he? This at last is the Great Peace. Right now,
where is he?
He comes back by night to stay here at fu Peak.

He pokes out your eyes. Still, he's raising waves where
there's no wind. But say, is it the Body of Reality or the
Body of Buddha? I'll give you thirty blows!

or crack and come out with a verse to make people see. Yun

nonetheless say, "One, two, three, four, five, six"? In fact not
even the blue-eyed barbarian monk can count up to it. That is
why it is said, "I just allow that the old barbarian knows-1
don't allow that he understands." Only a descendant of Yun
Men's house (like Hsueh Tau) could do this. I just said that
Yun Men responds to the time and adapts to the season with
one word, one phrase. Only if you can penetrate through will
you know that the Path is not a matter of words and phrases.
But if you're not yet this way, you won't avoid making up
intellectual interpretations.
My late master Wu Tsu said, "Shakyamuni Buddha was a
lowdown hired worker. The cypress trees in the garden: one,
two, three, four, five." If you can manage truly to see under
Yun Men's words, you'll reach this realm instantly.
"Shao Lin deceptively said he passed it on to Shen Kuang."
The Second Patriarch's initial name was Shen Kuang. Later he
said that Bodhidharma had returned to India. Bodhidharma had
been buried at the foot of Bear Ears Mountain. At that time the
(Liu) Sung emissary Yun Feng was returning from the West. In
the Western Mountains he saw Bodhidharma carrying one shoe
in his hand going back to India. The emissary returned and
reported this to the Emperor. When Bodhidharma's tomb was
opened they only saw a single shoe left behind.
Hsueh Tau says, "How can this matter really be imparted?"
Since there was no imparting it, Bodhidharma rolled up his
robe and said he was returning to India. But then tell me, why
has this country nevertheless had six patriarchs handing it on
in succession this way? Here it's unavoidably obscure. You
must be able to comprehend before you can enter and act.
"India is vast, there's no place to look for him- I He comes
back by night to stay here at Ju Peak." But tell me, where is he
right now?
Master Yuan Wu then struck saying, "Blind men!"

TRANSLATORS NOTES

a.

The Body of Reality (Dharmakaya) is called the real true body of
all Buddhas, the most essential and most inclusive aspect of Bud­
dhahood. Different elaborations on the nature of Dharmakaya
have been made in the various schools of Buddhist thought and

Forty-seventh Case

283

practice. Sometimes it is said to comprise two complementary
aspects, knowledge and principle, meaning realization of the in­
herent pattern that matter-energy is one with a void like empty
space. The infinite universe or cosmos itself can be seen as the
Dharmakaya of True Suchness, represented in the esoteric
schools as the manifestation of Vairocana Buddha, the universal
illuminator, the so-called Adibuddha or Primordial Buddha. Ac­
cording to esoteric Buddhist teaching, the exoteric schools regard
the Dharmakaya as being unmanifest and inexpressible, whereas
the esoteric schools see that it is also manifest and expressive. As
in the present case, Ch'an Buddhism sees both sides of this. Seng
Chao, the great sage of the Middle Path school, quoted several
times in this case, said that the Dharmakaya is uncompounded
and is not contained in sets of classification or enumeration. See
also Cases 39 and 82.

FORTY-EIGHTH CASE

Turning Over the Tea Kettle at
ChaoCh'ing
CASE

When Minister Wang entered Chao Ch'ing, they were making
tea.1 At the time Elder Lang was holding the kettle for Ming
Chao.2 Lang turned the tea kettle over.3 Seeing this, the Minis­
ter asked the Elder, "What's under the tea stove?"4 Lang said,
11The spirit who holds up stoves."5 The Minister said, "If it's
the spirit who holds up stoves, why then did you tum over the
tea kettle?1'6 Lang said, "Serve as an official for a thousand
days, lose it in a single moming.1'7 The Minister shook out his
sleeves and left. 8
Ming Chao said, 11Elder Lang, you've eaten Chao Ch'ing
food, but still you go beyond the river to make noise gathering
charred wood."9 Lang said, "What about you, Teacher?"10
Ming Chao said, 11The spirit got the advantage."11
Hsueh Tau said, "At the time I just would have kicked over
the tea stove."12

NOTES
1. A gathering of adepts: there's bound to be something extraordi­

nary. Casual and unconcerned. Everyone set one eye on them.
Wang has invited trouble.
2. A bunch of fellows playing with a mud ball. Lang doesn't know
how to make tea, so he drags in someone else.
3. Something's happened after all.
4. As it turns out, it's trouble.

5. After all he runs into Wang's arrow. Nonetheless, it's extraordi­
nary.
6. Why doesn't he give him some real provisions? Something's hap­
pened.

7. A mistaken indication. What kind of talk is this? Phoney Ch'an

men are (as numerous) as hemp seeds, as millet grains.
8. Obviously an adept. I allow that he has one eye.
9. I would go on to give him thirty blows. This lone-eye dragon

only has one eye. Still, it takes a clear-eyed man to examine
thoroughly.
10. He presses him-he too deserves to be pressed. Never make up

such dead senile views!
11. After all, he only has one eye. He was able to speak half. One hand

presses down, one hand lifts up.
12. What can be done about it? He draws his bow after the thief has

gone. Nonetheless, he still can't be called a member of Te Shan's
school. The lot of them, (Wang, Lang, and Ming Chao) are rascals,
scoundrels-among them Hsueh Tau is the stand-out.

COMMENTARY

Minister Wang was in charge of Ch'uan Chou. He had studied
at Chao Ch'ing for a long time. One day he went into the
temple while Elder Lang was making tea, and Lang turned over
the tea kettle. The Minister too was an adept. As soon as he
saw him tum over the tea kettle he immediately asked the
Elder, "What is under the tea stove?" When Lang said, "The
spirit who holds up stoves," inevitably there was an echo in his
words. But what could he do about his head and tail contradict­
ing each other, so that he lost the source meaning and blun­
dered with the sharp point, cutting his own hand? Not only did
he wrong himself, but he also offended the other man.
Though this is an affair without gain and loss, if we bring it
up, as before there is near and far, initiate and outsider. If you
discuss this matter, though it's not in words and phrases,
nevertheless you must discern what's alive in the words and
phrases. Thus it is said, "He only studies the living phrase; he
doesn't study the dead phrase."
When Elder Lang talked this way he was like a mad dog
chasing a clod of dirt. The Minister shook out his sleeves and
left, appearing to disapprove of him.
Ming Chao said, "Elder Lang, you've eaten Chao Ch'ing
food, but still you go beyond the river to make noise gathering
charred wood." This charred wood is sticks of wood burnt by

286

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

fire in the wild. Ming Chao used this to illustrate how Elder
Lang didn't go to the correct place to walk, but instead ran off
outside. Lang pressed him saying, "What about you, Teacher?"
Ming Chao said, "The spirit got the advantage." Naturally
Ming Chao had a place to show himself without turning his
back on Lang's question. Thus it is said, "A good dog bites in
without showing his teeth."
Master Che of Kuei Shan said, "Minister Wang was like
Hsiang Jua carrying off the jewel-in fact his sideburns were
sticking out from under his hat." Since Ming Chao couldn't
contain his feelings, it was difficult for him to do what was
proper. If I had been Elder Lang, as soon as I saw the Minister
shake out his sleeves and go, I would have let go of the tea
kettle and laughed out loud. Why? If you see him but don't grab
him, it's hard to meet with him even in a thousand years."
If you wish to know the meaning of the Buddha-nature, you
must observe times and seasons, causes and conditions.
Haven't you heard? Pao Shou asked Nail Cutter Hu, "For a long
time I've heard of Nail Cutter Hu-aren't you him?" Hu said,
"I am." Shou said, "Can you drive nails into empty space?" Hu
said, "I invite the Master to come smash it." Shou then hit
him. Hu did not agree, so Shou said, ''Another day there will be
a talkative teacher who will examine this thoroughly for you."
Later Hu saw Chao Chou and related the previous conversa­
tion. Chou said, "Why were you hit by him?" Hu said, "I don't
know where the fault was." Chou said, "You couldn't even do
anything about this one crack, yet you went on to tell him to
break up empty space." At this Hu was stopped-Chou spoke
for him, "Well, nail up this one crack." At this Hu had an
awakening.
When Seven Masters Mi of Ching Chao returned from his
foot travels, an old adept asked him, "A piece of well-rope on a
moonlit night-people all called it a snake. I wonder what you
call it, Seven Masters, when you see the Buddha." Seven Mas­
ters said, "If there is something seen, then it's the same as
sentient beings." The old adept said, "This is a peach pit that
sprouts once in a thousand years."
National Teacher Chung asked the purple-clad Imperial At­
tendant Monk, "I hear tell that you have (written a commen­
tary) explaining the 'Consideration of Benefit' Scripture. Is this
so or not?" The Imperial Attendant said, "It is so." The Na-

Forty-eighth Case

287

tional Teacher said, "One must first understand the Buddha's
meaning to be fit to explain the scriptures." The Imperial At­
tendant said, "If I didn't understand the meaning, how could I
dare to say I've explained the Scripture?" The National
Teacher then ordered the servant to bring a bowl of water,
seven grains of rice, and a single chopstick. Putting them in the
bowl, he passed it to the Imperial Attendant and asked, "What
meaning is this?" The Imperial Attendant said, "I don't under­
stand." The National Teacher said, "You don't even under­
stand my meaning: how can you go on talking of Buddha's
meaning?"
(So we see) Minister Wang and Elder Lang were not the only
ones to have conversations like this.
At the end Hsueh Tou turns around and says, "At the time I
just would have kicked over the tea stove." Though Ming Chao
was like this, he never equalled Hsueh Tou. Hsueh Feng was
the cook in Tung Shan's congregation. One day when he was
sifting rice, Tung Shan asked, "What are you doing?" Feng said,
"Sifting rice." Shan said, "Do you sift the rice to get rid of the
grit, or do you sift the grit and get rid of the rice?" Feng said,
"Grit and rice are both removed at once." Shan said, "What
will the great congregation eat?" Feng turned the bowl over.
Shan said, "The right conditions for you are not here." Though
he acted this way, how can this compare with Hsueh Tou
saying, "At the time I just would have kicked over the tea
stove"? What time and season was it for them? Their action
naturally stands out in the present and shines through the ages:
they had a place of living liberation.
The verse says:

COMMENTARY

"Posing a question like creating a wind- I The responsive ac­
tion was not skillful." The Minister's question was not skill­
ful." The Minister's question was like swinging an axe (so
swiftly that) it creates a wind. This comes from (a story in)

Chuang Tzu: a man of Ying was plastering a wall. Only one
small gap remained, so he threw a gob of plaster on to fill it in,
whereupon a bit of plaster splashed down onto the tip of his
nose. Nearby was an axeman who said, "You filled that hole
very skillfully. I'll wield my axe and take that plaster off the tip
of your nose for you." Though the plaster on his nose was (as
small as) a fly speck, he let him remove it. The axeman swung
his axe so fast he created a wind and removed the plaster en­
tirely without cutting his nose. The man of Ying stood there
without losing his composure. This is what is called wondrous
skill on the part of both. Though Elder Lang did respond to
Minister Wang's actions, his words were without excellent
skillfulness. That's why Hsueh Tou said, "(Wang) poses a ques­
tion like creating a wind I (Lang's) responsive action was not
skillful."

Forty-eighth Case

289

"How lamentable: the lone-eyed dragon I Didn't display his
teeth and claws." Ming Chao speaking was indeed very out­
standing. Nevertheless, he didn't have the teeth and claws to
grasp clouds and hold onto fog. The bystander Hsueh Tau
didn't' approve. Not containing his feeling, he showed some
energy on behalf of Ming Chao.
Hsueh Tau secretly goes to merge with Minister Wang's
meaning. He versifies his own statement about kicking over
the tea stove: "Teeth and claws open I Producing clouds and
thunder I How many times I've gone through the waves of ad­
verse currents!" Yun Men said, "I don't expect you to have
waves that go against the current. Just have the mind that goes
along with the current and you'll be all right too." Thus it is
said, "If you comprehend at the living phrase, you'll never
forget." The words and phrases of Elder Lang and of Ming Chao
seem dead. If you want to see the living place, just look at
Hsueh Tau kicking over the tea stove.

San Sheng's Golden Fish Who Has
Passed through the Net

POINTER

Piercing, penetrating, one takes the drum and captures the flag.
Fortified, entrenched, one inspects the front and oversees the
rear.
One who sits on the tiger's head to take the tiger's tail is not
yet an adept. Though an ox head disappears and a horse head
returns, this too is not yet extraordinary.
But say, how is it when a man who has passed beyond mea­
surements comes? To test I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

San Sheng asked Hsueh Feng, "I wonder, what does the golden
fish who has passed through the net use for food?"1
Feng said, "When you come out of the net I'll tell you."2
Sheng said, "The teacher of fifteen-hundred people and you
don't even know what to say!"3
Feng said, "My affairs as abbot are many and complicated."4

NOTES

Forty-ninth Case

291

COMMENTARY

With Hsueh Feng and San Sheng, though there's one exit and
one entry, one thrust and one parry, there is no division into
victory and defeat. But say, what is the eye that these two
venerable adepts possess?
San Sheng received the secret from Lin Chi. He travelled all
over and everyone treated him as an eminent guest. Look at
him posing a question. How many people look but cannot find
him! He doesn't touch on inherent nature or the Buddha
Dharma: instead he asks, "What does the golden fish who has
passed through the net use for food?" But say, what was his
meaning? Since the golden fish who has passed through the net
ordinarily does not eat the tasty food of others, what does he
use for food?
Hsueh Feng is an adept: in a casual fashion he replies to San
Sheng with only ten or twenty percent. He just said to him,
"When you come out of the net, I'll tell you." Fen Yang would
call this "a question that displays one's understanding." In the
Ts'ao Tung tradition it would be called "a question that uses
things." You must be beyond categories and classifications,
you must have obtained the use of the great function, you must
have an eye on your forehead-only then can you be called a
golden fish who has passed through the net. Nevertheless,
Hsueh Feng is an adept and can't help but diminish the other
man's reputation by saying "When you come out of the net, I'll
tell you."
Observe how the two of them held fast to their territories,
towering up like ten thousand fathom walls. With this one
sentence of Hsueh Feng's anyone other than San Sheng would
have been unable to go on. Yet San Sheng too was an adept:
thus he knew how to say to him, "The teacher of fifteen
hundred people and you don't even know what to say!" But
Hsueh Feng said, "My affairs as abbot are many and compli­
cated." How obstinate this statement is!
When these adepts met, there was one capture and one
release-(each) acted weak when encountering strength and
acted noble when encountering meanness. If you form your
understanding in terms of victory and defeat, you haven't seen
Hsueh Feng even in dreams. Look at these two men: initially
both were solitary and dangerous, lofty and steep; in the end

292

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

both were dead and decrepit. But say, was there still gain and
loss, victory and defeat? When these adepts harmonized with
each other, it was necessarily not this way.
San Sheng was the Temple Keeper at Lin Chi. When Lin Chi
was about to pass on he directed, "After I'm gone you mustn't
destroy the treasure of the eye of my correct teaching." San
Sheng came forward and said, "How could we dare destroy the
treasure of the eye of your correct teaching, Master?" Chi said,
"In the future, how will you act when people ask questions?"
San Sheng then shouted. Chi said, "Who would have known
that the treasure of the eye of my correct teaching would perish
in this blind donkey?" San Sheng then bowed in homage. Since
he was a true son of Lin Chi's, he dared to respond like this.
Afterwards Hsueh Tau just versifies the golden fish who has
passed through the net, revealing where these adepts saw each
other. The verse says:

VERSE

The golden fish who has passed through the netA thousand soldiers are easy to get, but one general is hard

to find. What is the golden fish like? The thousand sages
can't do anything about it.
Stop saying he tarries in the water.

He stands beyond the clouds, leaping with life. But better
not make him out to be a fool.
He shakes the heavens and sweeps the earth,
An adept! An adept! This still isn't where he's extraordi­

nary. Let him come out (of the net)-what's to prevent it?
He flourishes his mane and wags his tail.
Who would presume to judge the whole from the surface?

He's performed a clever trick and startled the crowd.
When a thousand-foot whale spouts, vast waves fly,
San Sheng revolved over to That Side: he is indeed out­

standing! He's swallowed everyone in the world in a
single gulp.
At a single thunderclap, the pure wind gusts.
Having eyes and ears, but being like blind and deaf. Who

is not frightened?

Forty-ninth Case

293

The pure wind gusts­

Where? Bah!
Among gods and humans, how many know� How many�

Hsueh Feng holds down the front lines, San Sheng holds
down the rear. Why scatter dust and sand? I'll hit and say,
"Where are you?"

COMMENTARY

"The golden fish who has passed through the net- I Stop say­
ing he tarries in the water." Wu Tsu said that just this one
couplet alone completes the verse. Since it's the golden fish
who has passed through the net, how could he linger tarrying
in the water? He must be where the vast swelling floods of
white foamy waves tower up to the skies. But say, during the
twenty-four hours of the day, what does he use for food? All of
you go back to your places and try to see for sure.
Hsueh Tou said, "This matter is picked up and played with
according to one's capacity." When something like the golden
fish "flourishes his mane and wags his tail," he does in fact
shake heaven and earth.
"When a thousand-foot whale spouts, vast waves fly." This
versifies San Sheng saying, "The teacher of fifteen hundred
people and you don't even know what to say!" He was like a
whale spouting out giant waves. "At a single thunderclap, the
pure wind gusts." This versifies Hsueh Feng saying, "My af­
fairs as abbot are many and complicated." He was like the pure
wind gusting when a thunderclap sounds. The overall meaning
is to praise the two of them for both being adepts.
"The pure wind gusts- I Among gods and humans, how
many know? How many?" But say, what do these lines come
down to? When the pure wind arises, among gods and humans
how many can there be who will know?

But say, when taking charge of a situation directly, whether

how will you be able to speak a phrase to express yourself? To
test, I'm citing this old case: look!

COMMENTARY

Can you settle this case properly? If you can, then Yun Men's

three phrases are present.

Fiftieth Case

295

When questioned about this case, some say, "Each grain of
the food in the bowl is round; each drop of the water in the
bucket is wet." If you understand in this fashion, then you
don't see how Yun Men really helped the man.
The verse says:

VERSE

"Food in the bowl, water in the bucket"lt's obvious. Why scatter sand and dirt? You must wash
your mouth out for three years before you'll get it.

The talkative teacher can hardly open his mouth.
He draws in his tongue. Those who know the law fear it.
Why then bring it up this way?
Northern Dipper, Southern Star-their positions are not different:
Why call east west? Sitting, standing, still and solemn.
What's long is the long Body of Reality; what's short is
the short Body of Reality.

White foamy waves flooding the skies arise on level ground.
Several fathoms deep underfoot. Guest and host inter­

Heavens! Bah!

Stopping or not stopping,
What are you saying, Hsueh Tau? You are adding more
hatred and bitterness.

Each and every one is a rich man's son with no britches.
Quite decrepit! The onlooker laughs at them.

COMMENTARY

Previously, in his verse on (Case

14)

'Yun Men's An Appropri­

ate Statement,' Hsueh Tau said, "An appropriate statement I
How utterly unique! I He wedges a stake into the iron hammer
head with no handle hole." Later, in his verse on (Case 73) 'Ma

296

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Tsu's Beyond All the Permutations of Assertion and Denial,'
he says, "Tsang's head is white, Hai's head is black I Clear-eyed
patchrobed monks cannot understand." If you are able to pene­
trate these cases, then you will see this present verse.
At the start Hsueh Tou immediately says, "Food in the
bowl, water in the bucket." There's an echo in his words; he
shows his capacity in the line. "The talkative teacher can
hardly open his mouth." With this he adds footnotes for you. If
you demand rational calculations here of the mysterious and
the wondrous, it will be even harder to open your mouths.
�t the beginning he holds fast. Fearing that there would be
someone with eyes in the assembly who would see through
him, later he had to forego the primary and bend down to open
it up for beginners, coming out with a verse to make people see.
As before the Northern Dipper is in the north and the Southern
Star is in the south. Thus he says, "Northern Dipper, Southern
Star-their positions are not different."
"White foamy waves flooding the skies arise on level
ground." When waves suddenly arise on level ground, what
will you do? If you catch sight of it in the phenomena, then it's
easy. If you seek for it in your conceptual faculty, then you will
never be able to find it. This line is like an iron spike: it can't
be pulled out, and you can't get your beak into it. If you try to
discuss it, though you wish to understand, you won't under­
stand; though you wish to stop, you won't stop wildly display­
ing your load of ignorance. This is precisely (what is meant by)
"Each and every one is a rich man's son with no britches."
Han Shan's poem says:
Everywhere constantly suffering pain,
All over vainly discussing themselves,
Though they have talent, it's abandoned in the
weedy swamps;
Having no power, they shut their reed doors.
The sun comes up over the cliff, but still it's dark,
The mist melts away, but the valley is still dim.
The rich men's sons there
Are all without britches.

FIFTY-FIRST CASE

Hsueh Feng's What Is It?

POINTER

As soon as there is affirmation and denial, you lose your mind
in confusion. If you don't fall into grades and stages, then there
is no seeking.
But say, is letting go right, or is holding fast right? At this
point, if you have any trace of an interpretative route, you are
still stuck in verbal explanations. If you're still involved with
devices and objects, then all of this is haunting the fields and
forests.a
Even if you arrive immediately at the point of solitary liber­
ation, you haven't avoided looking back to the village gate
from ten thousand miles away. Can you reach it? If you can't,
just comprehend this perfectly obvious public case. To test I
am citing it: look!

CASE

When Hsueh Feng was living in a hut, there were two monks
who came to pay their respects.1 Seeing them coming, he
pushed open the door of the hut with his hand, popped out, and
said, "What is it?"2 A monk also said, "What is it?"3 Feng
lowered his head and went back inside the hut.4
Later the monk came to Yen T'ou.5 T'ou asked, "Where are
you coming from?"6 The monk said, "I've come from Ling
Nan."7 T'ou said, "Did you ever go to Hsueh Feng?"8 The
monk said, "I went there."9 T'ou said, "What did he have to
say?" The monk recounted the preceding story.10 T'ou said,
"What did he say?"11 The monk said, "He said nothing; he
lowered his head and went back inside the hut."12 T'ou said,
"Alas! It's too bad I didn't tell him the last word before; 13 if I
had told him, no one on earth could cope with old Hsueh."14
At the end of the summer the monk again brough t up the
preceding story to ask for instruction.15 T'ou said, "Why didn't

you ask earlier?"16 The monk said, "I didn't dare to be
casual."17 T'ou said, "Though Hsueh Feng is born of the same
lineage as me, he doesn't die in the same lineage as me.18 If you
want to know the last word, just this is it."19

pierced his nostrils. An imprisoned man increases in wisdom. It's
already a double case.

COMMENTARY

Whoever would uphold the teaching of our school must discern
how to take charge of the situation; he must know advance and
retreat, right and wrong; he must understand killing and giving
life, capturing and releasing. If one's eyes suddenly blur and go
sightless, everywhere he goes, when he encounters a question,
he questions, and when he encounters an answer, he answers,
scarcely realizing that his nostrils are in the hands of others.
As for Hsueh Feng and Yen T'ou, they were fellow students
under Te Shan. When these monks called on Hsueh Feng their
views only reached to such a place (as seen in the case); when
the monk saw Yen T'ou, he still didn't complete his business.
He troubled these two worthies to no purpose. One question,
one answer, one capture, one release-right up till today this
case has been impenetrably obscure and inexplicable for
everyone in the world. But tell me, where is it impenetrable
and obscure?
Though Hsueh Feng had travelled all over through the vari­
ous localities, at last it was at Tortoise Mountain because Yen
T'ou spurred him on that he finally attained annihilation of
doubt and great penetration.
Later, due to a purge, Yen T'ou became a ferryman by the
shores of Lake 0 Chu (in Hupeh). On each shore hung a board:
when someone wanted to cross, he would knock on the board.
T'ou would call out, "Which side are you crossing to?" Then he
would wave his oar and come out from among the reeds.
(After his enlightenment with Yen T'ou) Hsueh Feng re­
turned to Ling Nan and lived in a hut. These monks were
people who had studied for a long time. When he saw them
coming, Hsueh Feng pushed open the door of the hut, popped
out and said, "What is it?" Some people these days when ques­
tioned in this way immediately go and gnaw on his words. But
these monks were unusual too; they just said to him "What is
it?" Feng lowered his head and went back into the hut. This is
frequently called "wordless understanding;'' hence,

these

monks couldn't find him. Some say that, having been ques­
tioned by these monks, Hsueh Feng was in fact speechless, and
so he returned to the hut. How far they are from knowing that
there is something deadly poisonous in Hsueh Feng's inten­
tion. Though Hsueh Feng gained the advantage, neverthe­
less while he hid his body, he revealed his shadow.

300

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Later one monk left Hsueh Feng and took this case to have
Yen T'ou decide it. Once he got there, Yen T'ou asked him,
"Where are you coming from?" The monk said, "I've come
from Ling Nan." T'ou said, "Did you get to Hsueh Feng?" If
you want to see Hsueh Feng, you better hurry up and look at
this question. The monk said, "I went there." T'ou said, "What
did he have to say?" This question was not posed to no pur­
pose. But the monk did not understand: he just turned around
following the trend of his words. T'ou said, "What did he say?"
The monk said, "He lowered his head and went back into the
hut without saying anything." This monk was far from know­
ing that Yen T'ou had put on straw sandals and had already
walked around inside his belly several times.
Yen T'ou said, "Too bad I didn't tell him the last word be­
fore; if I had told him, no one on earth could cope with old
Hsueh." Yen T'ou too supports the strong but doesn't help the
weak. As before the monk was flooded with darkness and
didn't distinguish initiate from naive. Harboring a bellyful of
doubt, he really thought that Hsueh Feng did not understand.
At the end of the summer he again brought up this story and
asked Yen T'ou for more instruction. T'ou said, "Why didn't
you ask earlier?" This old fellow was crafty. The monk said, "I
didn't dare to be casual." T'ou said, "Though Hsueh Feng is
born of the same lineage as me, he doesn't die in the same
lineage as me. If you want to know the last word, just this is
it." Yen T'ou indeed did not spare his eyebrows! In the end,
how will all of you people understand?
Hsueh Feng was the cook in Te Shan's community. One day
the noon meal was late; Te Shan took his bowl and went down
to the teaching hall. Feng said, "The bell hasn't rung yet, the
drum hasn't been sounded-where is this old fellow going with
his bowl?" Without saying anything, Te Shan lowered his head
and returned to his abbot's quarters. When Hsueh Feng took
this up with Yen T'ou, T'ou said, "Even the great Te Shan
doesn't understand the last word."
Te Shan heard of this and ordered his attendant to summon
Yen T'ou to the abbot's quarters. Shan said, "So you don't
approve of me?" T'ou tacitly indicated what he meant. The
next day Shan went up to the hall and taught in a way which
was different from usual; in front of the monks' hall T'ou
clapped his hands and laughed loudly saying, "Happily the old

Fifty-first Case

301

fellow does understand the last word! After this no one on
earth will be able to do anything about him. Nevertheless, he's
only got three years."
When Hsueh Feng saw Te Shan speechless, he thought that
he had gained the advantage. He certainly didn't know that he
had run into a thief. Since he had met a thie( later Feng too
knew how to be a thief. Thus an Ancient said, "At the final
word, one first reaches the impenetrable barrier."
Some say that Yen T'ou excelled Hsueh Feng; they have
misunderstood. Yen T'ou always used this ability; he taught
his community saying, "Clear-eyed folks have no cliches to
nest in. Spuming things is considered superior, pursuing things
is considered inferior. As for this last word, even if you've
personally seen the Patriarchs, you still wouldn't be able to
understand it rationally."
When Te Shan's noon meal was late, the old fellow picked
up his bowl himself and went down to the teaching hall. Yen
T'ou said, "Even great Te Shan doesn't understand the last
word." Hsueh Tou picked this out and said, "I've heard that
from the beginning a lone-eyed dragon has only one eye. You
certainly didn't know that Te Shan was a toothless tiger. If it
hadn't been for Yen T'ou seeing through him, how could we
know that yesterday and today are not the same? Do all of you
want to understand the last word? An Ancient said, 'I only
allow that the old barbarian knows; I don't allow that he un­
derstands."'
From ancient times up till now, the public cases have been
extremely diverse, like a forest of brambles. If you can pene­
trate through, no one on earth can do anything about you, and
all the Buddhas of past, present, and future defer to you. If you
are unable to penetrate, study Yen T'ou saying, "Though
Hsueh Feng is born in the same lineage as me, he doesn't die in
the same lineage as me." Spontaneously, in just this one sen­
tence, he had a way to express himself.

VERSE

The last word
It's already present before any words. You think it's real.
If you look right now at it, you'll go blind.

Is spoken for you;
The tongue falls to the ground. It can't be spoken. It has a

Like an ox without horns, like a tiger with horns. This
one and that one are this way.

What clan is this? There's no connection between this

Even Yellow Head (Buddha) and Blue Eyes (Bodhidharma)

Everyone on earth loses his point and is tongue-tied. I too
am this way; nevertheless, others are not. "I only allow
that the old barbarian knows; I don't allow that he under­

They still have half a month's journey. Let the world be

is no one who understands. You too are just blind people:
do you know the last word? I'll hit!

COMMENTARY

"The last word is spoken for you." When Hsueh Tau made up
his verse on this last word, he intentionally went to extremes
falling into the weeds to help people. His verse was thorough-

Fifty-first Case

303

going as a verse, but he only versified a little of the fine detail.

If you want to see all the way through, this is still not enough.
Daring to say even more, Hsueh Tou opened his big mouth
and said, "The time of ligh t and dark pair by pair" to open a
road for you and also to finish it off for you in one line. Then at
the end he provided even more explanations for you. Just as
Chao Ch'ing one day asked Lo Shan, "When Yen T'ou says, 'So,
so, not so, not so,' what is his meaning?" Lo Shan called out,
"Great Master," and Master Chao Ch'ing responded. Shan said,
"Both light and both dark." Ch'ing bowed in thanks and left.
Three days later he again questioned Lo Shan, "A few days ago I
received your compassionate instruction;

it's just that

I

couldn't see through it." Shan said, "I've told you the whole
thing already." Ch'ing said, "Master, please light the way."
Shan said, "If so, Great Master, go ahead and ask about what
you are in doubt over." Ch'ing said, "What is 'both light and
both dark'?" Shan said, "Born the same and dying the same."
Then Ch'ing bowed in thanks and left.
Later there was a monk who asked Chao Ch'ing, "How is it
when being born the same and dying the same?" Ch'ing said,
"Shut your dog mouth." The monk said, "Try to eat food with
your mouth closed, Great Master." This monk then came to
ask Lo Shan, "How is it when being born the same and dying
the same?" Shan said, "Like an ox without horns." The monk
asked, "How is it when being born the same but not dying the
same?" Shan said, "Like a tiger with horns." The last word is
precisely this truth.
There was a monk in Lo Shan's congregation who used this
idea to put a question to Chao Ch'ing. Ch'ing said, "This one,
this one, they all know. Why? If I spoke a phrase on the eastern
continent, they would know it on the western continent too. If
I spoke a phrase in heaven, in the human world they would also
know it. All minds know each other, all eyes shine on each
other."
Born of the same lineage, they're still easy to see. Not dying
in the same lineage, they're utterly separate, and not even
Shakyamuni or Bodhidharma can find them.
"South, North, East, West, let us return." There's something
of a good world. "And in the depths of night together look at
the snow on the thousand crags." But say, is this "both light
and both dark" or is it "born of the same lineage" or is it "dying

FIFTY-SECOND CASE

Chao Chou Lets Asses Cross, Lets
Horses Cross

CASE

A monk asked Chao Chou, "For a long time I've heard of the

stone bridge of Chao Chou, but now that I've come here I just
see a simple log bridge."1
Chou said, "You just see the log bridge; you don't see the
stone bridge."2
The monk said, "What is the stone bridge?"3
Chou said, "It lets asses cross, it lets horses cross."4

NOTES
1.

Here's another man who comes to grab the tiger's whiskers. This
is the proper business of patchrobed monks.

2.

Chou is accustomed to getting the advantage. This old fellow is
selling off his body.

3.
4.

He's climbed up onto Chou's hook, after all.
A single net cast over "asses" and "horses." In fact all the people

in the world have no place to breathe; once dead they don't come
back to life again.

COMMENTARY

In (the place) Chao Chou there's a stone bridge; ever since it
was built (in the Latter Han dynasty) by Li Ying, it has been
famous throughout the country. A simple log bridge is a bridge
(made of) a single log.
Intentionally downgrading (Chao Chou's) grandeur, this
monk questioned him saying, "For a long time I've heard of the
stone bridge of Chao Chou, but now that I've come here I just
see a simple log bridge." Chou immediately said, "You just see
305

306

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

the log bridge, but you don't see the stone bridge," based on the
other man's question. This seems just like ordinary conversa­
tion, but Chao Chou used it to hook him. This monk after all
climbed onto the hook; he followed up behind and asked,
"What is the stone bridge?" Chou said, "It lets asses cross, it
lets horses cross." Inevitably Chao Chou naturally has a place
to show himself in his words. Chao Chou is not like Lin Chi or
Te Shan, carrying on with blows and shouts-he just uses
words and speech to kill and bring to life.
Take a good look at this case. It seems to be an ordinary
battle of wits; it is nevertheless hard to approach.
One day Chao Chou was with the head monk looking at the
stone bridge when he asked the head monk, "Who built this?"
The head monk said, "Li Ying built it." Chou said, "When he
built it, where did he start?" The head monk had no reply.
Chou said, "You're always talking about the stone bridge, but
when you're asked about where it was started, you don't even
know."
Also one day when Chao Chou was sweeping the floor, a
monk asked, "Teacher, you are a man of knowledge-why is
there dust?" Chou said, "It's something that comes from out­
side." Again the monk asked, "In a pure and clean monastery,
why is there dust?" Chou said, "There's another little bit."
Also a monk asked, "What is the Path?" Chou said, "It's
outside the wall." The monk said, "I'm not asking about that
path, I'm asking about the Great Way." Chou said, "The Great
Way runs through the capital."
Chao Chou was partial to using such devices; he would go to
the safe secure place of ordinary reality to help people. He
never cut his hand on the sharp point; naturally he was solitary
and lofty, using these devices most wondrously.
Hsueh Tau's verse says,

VERSE

He doesn't set up the solitary and dangerous; in that his path
is lofty.
You must get to this realm before you realize. The words
are still in our ears. This goes back to his own provisions.

Fifty-second Case

307

Entering the ocean, he must hook a giant tortoise.

He cuts off the essential crossing place and doesn't let
profane or holy pass. Shrimps or clams, snails or oysters
aren't worth asking about. People of power don't come by
twos and threes.
His contemporary the Elder of Kuan Hsi is worth a laugh;

There's been another such man who's come this way,
who had such ability to use active devices.
Though he knew how to say "Whistling Arrow," his effort was
in vain.
He still has half a month's journey. He seems to resemble,

but isn't really.

COMMENTARY

"He doesn't set up the solitary and dangerous; in that his path
is lofty." Hsueh Tau is praising Chao Chou's usual way of
helping people. Chou doesn't establish mysteries or marvels,
and doesn't set up the solitary and dangerous. He isn't like
those in various places who say that only breaking up empty
space, smashing Mount Sumeru to bits, producing dust on the
bottom of the ocean and pounding waves on Mount Sumeru
can be called the Path of the Patriarchal Teachers. Thus Hsueh
Tou says, "He doesn't set up the solitary and dangerous; in that
his path is lofty." Others may tower up like ten-mile-high
walls to display the extraordinary spiritual effects of the
Buddha Dharma-but though they're solitary and dangerous,
lofty and steep, this is not as good as not setting up the solitary
and dangerous, and simply acting ordinary, naturally turning
smoothly. Chao Chou doesn't establish anything, yet he is es­
tablished himself; he doesn't make anything high, yet he is
high himself. When capacity goes beyond solitary and danger­
ous, only then do we see profound wonders.
Thus Hsueh Tau says, "Entering the ocean, he must hook a
giant tortoise." Look at Chao Chou: a master of our school
with eyes, he is perfectly at ease as he imparts a word and
employs a device. He doesn't hook shrimps or clams, snails or
oysters-he only hooks giant tortoises. Indeed he is an adept!
This one line is used to illustrate the Case.

308

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"His contemporary the Elder of Kuan Hsi is worth laughing
at." Haven't you heard-a monk asked Kuan Hsi, "I've long
heard of Kuan Hsi ('Pouring Mountain Stream'). Now that I've
come here I only see a hemp-soaking pool." Hsi said, "You just
see the hemp-soaking pool; you don't see the pouring moun­
tain stream." The monk said, "What is the pouring mountain
stream?" Hsi said, "Swift as a whistling arrow."
Also a monk asked Huang Lung, "I've long heard of Huang
Lung ('Yellow Dragon'), but now that I've come here I only see
a red striped snake." Lung said, "You just see the red striped
snake; you don't see the yellow dragon." The monk said,
"What is the yellow dragon?" Lung said, "Slithering along."
The monk said, "How is it when he suddenly encounters the
(dragon-eating) Garuda bird?" Lung said, "Difficult to stay
alive." The monk said, "If so, then he'll get eaten up by the
bird." Lung said, "Thank you for feeding me."
These are both cases of setting up the solitary and danger­
ous. Though Kuan Hsi and Huang Lung are both right,
nevertheless they did waste effort. They never equalled Chao
Chou's ordinary action. That's why Hsueh Tou says, "Though
he knew how to say 'Whistling Arrow,' his effort was in vain."
Leaving Kuan Hsi and Huang Lung aside for the moment,
how will you understand when Chao Chou says, "It lets asses
cross, it lets horses cross"? Try to do it.

FIFTY-THIRD CASE

Pai Chang's Wild Ducks

POINTER

The whole world does not hide it-his entire capacity stands
alone revealed. He encounters situations without getting
stuck-with every move he has the ability to assert himself. In
his phrases there's no partiality-everywhere he has the inten­
tion to kill people.
But say, in the end, where do the Ancients go to rest? To test
I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

Once when Great Master Ma and Pai Chang were walking
together they saw some wild ducks fly by.1 The Great Master
asked, "What is that?"2 Chang said, "Wild ducks."3 The Great
Master said, "Where have they gone? "4 Chang said, "They've
flown away."5 The Great Master then twisted Pai Chang's
nose.6 Chang cried out in pain. 7 The Great Master said, "When
have they ever flown away?"8

Two fellows in the weeds. They're rolling around in the weeds.
Why suddenly notice the ducks?

You should know, Teacher. This old fellow doesn't even know his
nostrils.

offers the actual facts. The second ladleful of foul water will be
even more poisonous.

4.

His first arrow was still light, but the second arrow is deep. A
second enticing peck. Here too Ma Tsu should know for himself.

right in front of him.

been making his living inside a ghost cave.

COMMENTARY

If you observe this case with the correct eye, unexpectedly it's
Pai Chang who has the correct basis, whereas Great Master Ma
is creating waves where there is no wind. If all of you want to
be teachers of Buddhas and Patriarchs, then study Pai Chang. If
you want to be unable to save even yourselves, then study the
Great Master Ma. Observe how those Ancients were never ab­
sent from Here, twenty-four hours a day.
At a young age Pai Chang left behind the dusts of wordly life
and became well versed in the three studies (discipline, medi­
tation, and wisdom). When Ma Tsu (known as) Ta Chi was
teaching at Nan Ch'ang, Pai Chang set his heart on joining
him. For twenty years he served as Ma Tsu's attendant, until
the time of his second calling (on Ma Tsu, as related in the
commentary to Case 11), when he was finally greatly en­
lightened at Ma Tsu's shout.
But these days some say, "Where there is fundamentally no
enlightenment, they construct the gate of 'enlightenment' and
establish this affair." If you view it in this way, you are like a
flea on a lion's body feeding itself on the lion's flesh. Haven't
you seen where an Ancient said, "If the source is not deep, the
stream is not long; if the wisdom is not great, the vision is not
far-reaching." If you entertain the understanding that en­
lightenment is a construct, how could the Buddhist Teaching
have come down to the present?
Look: once when Great Master Ma and Pai Chang were
walking together they saw some wild ducks fly by. How could
the Great Master not have known they were wild ducks? Why
did he nevertheless ask like this? Tell me, what does his mean­
ing come down to? When Pai Chang merely followed up behind
him, Ma Tsu then twisted his nose. Chang cried out in pain

Fifty-third Case

311

and Ma Tsu said, "When have they ever flown away?" At this
Pai Chang had insight. But these days some people misun­
derstand: as soon as they're questioned, they immediately
make a cry of pain. Fortunately they can't leap out of it.
When teachers of our school help people, they must make
them penetrate through. You see that Pai Chang didn't under­
stand, that he didn't avoid cutting his hand on the point. Ma
Tsu just wanted to make him understand this matter. Thus it
is said, "When you understand, you can make use of it wher­
ever you are; if you don't understand, then the conventional
truth prevails." If Ma Tsu hadn't twisted Pai Chang's nose at
that time, the conventional truth would have prevailed. It's
also necessary when encountering circumstances and meeting
conditions to turn them around and return them to oneself; to
have no gaps at any time is called "the ground of nature bright
and clear." What's the use of one who just haunts the forests
and fields, accepting what's ahead of an ass but behind a
horse?a
Observe how Ma Tsu and Pai Chang act this way; though
they seem radiant and spiritual, nevertheless they don't remain
in radiance and spirituality. Pai Chang cried out in pain; if you
see it as such, then the whole world does not hide it, and it is
perfectly manifest everywhere. Thus it is said, "Penetrate one
place, and you penetrate a thousand places, ten thousand
places all at once."
When Ma Tsu went up to the hall the next day, as soon as
the congregation had assembled, Pai Chang came forward and
rolled up the bowing mat. Ma Tsu immediately left his seat.
After he had returned to his abbot's quarters, he asked Pai
Chang, "I had just gone up to the hall and had not yet preached;
why did you roll up the mat right away?" Chang said, "Yester­
day I had my nose twisted by you, Teacher, and it hurt." Tsu
said, "Where were you keeping your mind yesterday?" Chang
said, "Today the nose no longer hurts." Tsu said, "You have
profound knowledge of Today's affair.'' Chang then bowed and
returned to the attendants' quarters, crying. One of his fellow
attendants asked, "Why are you crying?" Chang said, "Go ask
our Master." The attendant then went to ask Ma Tsu. Tsu said,
"Go ask Pai Chang." When the attendant returned to their
quarters to ask Pai Chang, Chang laughed loudly. The atten­
dant said, "You were just crying-now why are you laughing?"

312

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Chang said, "I was crying before, now I'm laughing." Look at
Pai Chang after his enlightenment; turning smoothly, he can't
be trapped. Naturally he's sparkling clear on all sides.

VERSE

Wild ducks-

Gathering in flocks. Here's another one.

Why use wild ducks? They're as numerous as hemp or
millet seeds.
Ma Tsu saw them coming and they had words with each
other-

What end is there to creating complications? What did
they say? Ma Tsu alone recognizes the outstanding one.
He told all about the scene of the clouds on the mountains and
the moon over the sea.

The ladle handle of the eastern house is long; the ladle
handle of the western house is short. Who knows how
many complications he created?
As before Chang didn't understand, but said, "They've flown
away."
Gaa! Don't say he didn't know how to speak. Where did

they fly off to?
Pai Chang wanted to fly away,

His nostrils were in the other man's hands. This is already
adding footnotes for others.
But Ma Tsu held him fast.

With grandmotherly kindness. What else did he say?
Speak! Speak!

What is there to say? Don't make me speak too. Don't
make a wild duck cry. Heavens! Right where you are you
deserve thirty blows. Who knows where they went to?

COMMENTARY

Directly and immediately, Hsueh Tau makes his verse saying,
"Wild ducks-who knows where they are?" But say, how

Fifty-third

Case

313

many are there? "Ma Tsu saw them coming and they had
words with each other." This versifies Ma Tsu asking Pai
Chang, "What is that?" and Chang saying, "Wild ducks." "He
told all about the scene of the clouds on the mountains and the
moon over the sea." This versifies Ma Tsu again asking,
"Where have they gone?" The teaching which Great Master
Ma conveyed to Pai Chang spontaneously revealed everything.
As before Chang did not understand; instead he said, "They've
flown away." Twice he missed it.
With "Pai Chang wanted to fly away, but Ma Tsu held him
fa�t," Hsueh Tou settles the case on the basis of the facts. He
also says, "Speak! Speak!" This is where Hsueh Tou turns
himself around. But say, how will you speak? If you make a cry
of pain, then you're wrong. If you don't make a cry of pain, then
how do you understand it? Though Hsueh Tou versifies most
wondrously, no matter what he does he can't leap out either.

"What's ahead of an ass but behind a horse" is often referred
specifically to the ·'radiant spirituality," a designation of the con­

done?

COMMENTARY

Yun Men asked this monk, "Where did you come here from?"
The monk said, "Hsi Ch'an." This is direct face to face talk,
like a flash of lightening. Men said, "What words and phrases
are there at Hsi Ch'an these days?" This too is just ordinary
conversation. This monk, however, is also an adept; contrary
to expectations, he goes to test Yun Men-he immediately
extended his two hands. If it had been an ordinary person who
met with this test, we would have seen him flustered and agi­
tated. But Yun Men has a mind like flint struck sparks, like
flashing lightening; immediately he slapped him.
The monk said, "You may hit me all right, but nevertheless
I'm still talking." This monk had a place to turn around, so
Yun Men opened up and extended his two hands. The monk
was speechless, so Yun Men hit him.
Look-since Yun Men is an adept, whenever he takes a step
he knows where the step comes down. He knows how to ob­
serve in front and take notice behind, not losing his way. This
monk only knows how to look ahead; he's unable to observe
behind.

VERSE

At once he takes the tiger's head and the tiger's tailThe single-edged sword that kills people, the double­
edged sword that brings people to life. Only this monk
can handle it. A thousand soldiers are easy to get, but one
general is hard to find.

316

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

His stern majesty extends everywhere.
He cuts off the tongues of everyone on earth. He covers
heaven and covers earth.
I ask back, "Didn't you know how dangerous it wast"
You shouldn't blindly fetter and beat them. From the be­
ginning Hsueh Tou himself didn't know. You are speak­
ing carelessly, Reverend.
Hsueh Tau says, "I leave off."
If he hadn't left off, then what? Everyone on earth loses
out all at once. I hit the meditation seat once.

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou's verse on this story is very easy to understand-its
overall meaning is to praise the sharp point of Yun Men's abil­
ity. Thus he says, "At once he takes the tiger's head and the
tiger's tail." An Ancient said, "Occupy the tiger's head, take
the tiger's tail, then at the first phrase you'll understand the
source meaning." Hsueh Tou just settles the case on the basis
of the facts. He likes the way Yun Men is able to occupy the
tiger's head and also take the tiger's tail. When the monk ex­
tended his two hands and Yun Men immediately hit him, this
was occupying the tiger's head. When Yun Men extended two
hands and the monk was speechless so that Yun Men hit him
again, this was taking the tiger's tail. When head and tail are
taken together, the eye is like a shooting star.
Yun Men is naturally like stone-struck sparks, like flashing
lightning; in fact, "His stem majesty extends everywhere."
The wind whistles all over the world.
"I ask back, 'Didn't you know how dangerous it was?"' Un­
avoidably there was danger. Hsueh Tou says, "I leave off." But
say, right now as I don't leave off, what will you do? Everyone
in the world will have to take a beating.
Followers of Ch'an these days all say that when Yun Men
extended his two hands, the monk should have repaid him
with some of his own provisions. This seems correct, but in
reality isn't. Yun Men can't just get you to stop this way­
there must be something else besides.

fiFTY-FIFTH CASE

Tao Wu's Condolence Call

POINTER

Secure and intimate with the whole of reality, one obtains
realization right there. In contact with the flow, able to turn
things around, one assumes responsibility directly.
As for cutting off confusion in the light of a stone-struck
spark or a flash of lightning, or towering up like a mile-high
wall where one occupies the tiger's head and takes the tiger's
tail-this I leave aside for the moment. Is there a way to help
people by letting out a continuous path or not? To test, I cite
this: look!

CASE

Tao Wu and Chien Yuan went to a house to make a condolence
call. Yuan hit the coffin and said, "Alive or dead?"1 Wu said, "I
won't say alive, and I won't say dead."2 Yuan said, "Why won't
you say?"3 Wu said, "I won't say."4 Halfway back, as they were
returning,5 Yuan said, "Tell me right away, Teacher; if you
don't tell me, I'll hit you."6 Wu said, "You may hit me, but I
won't say,"7 Yuan then hit him.8
Later Tao Wu passed on. Yuan went to Shih Shuang and
brought up the foregoing story.9 Shuang said, "I won't say alive,
and I won't say dead."10 Yuan said, "Why won't you say?"11
Shuang said, "I won't say, I won't say."12 At these words Yuan
had an insight."13
One day Yuan took a hoe into the teaching hall and crossed
back and forth, from east to west and west to east.14 Shuang
said, "What are you doing?"15 Yuan said, "I'm looking for relics
of our late master."16 Shuang said, "Vast waves spread far and
wide, foaming billows flood the skies-what relics of our late
master are you looking for?"17
Hsueh Tau added a

NOTES
l. What is he saying? He sure isn't alert. This fellow is still lingering

in duality.
2. When a dragon puffs, fog gathers; when a tiger roars, wind rises.

He buys the hat to fit the head. He's kind-hearted.
3. He's stumbled past. As it turns out, he misunderstands.
4. He pours foul water right on Yuan's head. The first arrow was still

light, but the second arrow goes deep.
5. Not very alert.
6. If he hits, then he'll be getting somewhere. It's rare to meet with

the pierced-ear traveller (Bodhidharma); you often encounter
travellers who cut a notch in the boat (thinking to mark the spot
on the water which the boat is going over at a given time).• If you
are like this latter kind of fool, you'll enter hell as fast as an arrow.
7. Again and again he must repeat this. He gets in close to take him.

This old fellow's whole body is covered with muddy water. His
original attitude is unchanging.
8. He should be hit. But say, why does he hit him? From the begin­

ning there have been people who have received unjust beatings.
9. He knows, yet deliberately offends. He doesn't know whether

he's right or wrong-if he's right, that would be wonderful.
10. How fresh and new! Yet there have always been people who eat

this kind of food and drink.
1 1. Though his words are the same, his intent is different. But say, is

this the same as or different from his asking before?
12. In the heavens and on earth. If the waves of Ts'ao Ch'i resembled

each other, innumerable ordinary people would get bogged down.
13. The blind man! Better not fool me.
14. Within death he has found life. He should show some life for his

late master. Don't question him-but observe this fellow's em­
barrassment.
15. He just follows along behind.
16. He hangs a medicine bag on the back of a hearse. Too bad that he

was not so careful at first. What are you saying, Yuan?
17. Only that adept could do this. Why gather in crowds?

Fifty-fifth

18. Too late. Hsueh Tou draws his bow after the thief has gone. He

should be buried in the same pit.
19. But tell me, what does this really mean? What has the late master

ever said to you? From beginning to end, and even up till now,
this fellow has been unable to get himself out.
20. Does everyone see them? They're like flashing lightning. What

worn out straw sandals are these? Fu has realized a little bit.

COMMENTARY

Tao Wu and Chien Yuan went to a house to make a condolence
call. Yuan hit the coffin and said, "Alive or dead?" Wu said, "I
won't say alive, and I won't say dead." If you can immediately
enter at these lines, if at these words you immediately know
what they come down to, then this is the key to penetrating
beyond life and death. Otherwise, if you can't, then you will
miss it over and over again even though it's right in front of
you.
Observe how these Ancients, whether walking, standing,
sitting, or lying down, were always mindful of this matter. As
soon as they got to the house to offer condolences, Chien Yuan
hit the coffin and asked Tao Wu, "Alive or dead?" Without
stirring a hairsbreadth, Tao Wu answered him saying, "I won't
say alive, and I won't say dead." Chien Yuan was face to face
with it, but he stumbled past, running after the other man's
words. He went on to say, "Why won't you say?" Wu said, "I
won't say, I won't say." This can be called Wu meeting an error
with an error, his heart bared entirely.
Yuan was still not awake himself: halfway back as they
were returning he again said, "Tell me righ t away, Teacheri if
you don't tell me, I'll hit you." What does this fellow know of
good and bad? This is what is called "a good intention not
getting a good reward." With tender kindness as before, Tao
Wu said more to himi "You may hit me, but I won't say." Yuan
then hit him. Even so, Tao Wu nevertheless won the point. Tao
Wu was dripping with blood like this to help him, but Chien
Yuan could be so unseeing!
After being hit, Tao Wu then said to Chien Yuan, "You
should go away for a while. I fear that if the monastery's direc­
tor of affairs finds out, he would make trouble for you." He

320

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

secretly sent Chien Yuan away. Yuan later came to a small
temple where he heard a workman reciting the Avalokitesvara
scripture, where it says, "To those who would attain salvation
as monks, he appears as a monk to expound the Dharma for
them." Suddenly Yuan was greatly enlightened and said, "At
that time I was wrongly suspicious of my late teacher. How
was I to know that this affair isn't in words and phrases?" As an
Ancient said, "Even someone great beyond measure can be
whirled around in the stream of words."
Some interpret intellectually and say that when Tao Wu
said, "I won't say, I won't say," he had thereby already said
something, that this is what is called "turning a back-flip,
making people unable to get ahold of you." If you understand
in this fashion, how will you attain tranquility? If your feet
tread the real earth, you aren't even a hairsbreadth away.
Haven't you heard? Seven women sages were travelling
through the Forest of Corpses. One of the women pointed to a
corpse and asked her sisters, "The corpse is here-where is the
person?" The eldest sister said, "What? What?" and all seven
together experienced the tolerance of birthlessness. But say,
how many are there like this? In a thousand or ten thousand,
there's just one.
Later Chien Yuan went to Shih Shuang and related his pre­
vious conversation with Tao Wu. Same as before, Shih Shuang
said, "I won't say alive, and I won't say dead," and Yuan said,
"Why won't you say?" When Shih Shuang said, "I won't say, I
won't say," Yuan was immediately enlightened.
One day Yuan took a hoe into the teaching hall and crossed
back and forth, from east to west and west to east. He intended
to display his insight. Sure enough Shuang asked him, "What
are you doing?" Yuan said, "I'm looking for relics of our late
master." Shuang then cut off his footsteps, saying, "Vast waves
spread far and wide, foaming billows flood the skies-what
relics of our late master are you looking for?" Since Yuan was
looking for relics of the late master, why did Shih Shuang
nevertheless talk to him this way? At this point, if you can
comprehend the words, "I won't say alive, and I won't say
dead," then you will know that from beginning to end the
entire capacity is put to use. If you make up rationalizations,
hesitate and ponder, then it will be impossible to see.
Chien Yuan said, "This is just where I should apply effort."

Fifty-fifth Case

321

See how after his enlightenment he can speak spontaneously
so extraordinarily.
Tao Wu's skull bone was golden-hued; when struck it
sounded like metal.
Hsueh Tau commented, "Heavens! Heavens!" His meaning
comes down on both sides.
Fu of T'ai Yuan said, "The late master's relics are still pres­
ent." Naturally what he said was fitting-at once he put this
loose end in place.
But tell me, what is the most essential place? How is effort
applied? Haven't you heard it said that if you penetrate in one
place you penetrate in a thousand, ten-thousand places all at
once." If you can penetrate "I won't say, I won't say/' then you
cut off the tongues of everyone on earth. If you can't penetrate
this, then you must study for yourself and awaken yourself.
You mustn't take it easy and let the days go by-you must
value the time.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

There's no place to put them-

After all. Yet Hsueh Tou has managed somewhat. But as
it turns out he's sunk in a deep pit.
Even the one who returned to the West with one shoe has lost
them.b
If the ancestral shrine is not completed, the trouble ex­

tends to the descendants. I'll hit, saying, "Then why are
they here?"

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou understands how to add footnotes exceptionally
well. He is a descendant of Yun Men, with the hammer and
tongs to have three phrases present in every single phrase.
Where it's hard to express, he explains thoroughly; the un­
openable he opens up. He goes to the most crucial and essential
place and produces it in verse, immediately saying, "Rabbits
and horses have horns-oxen and rams have no horns." Tell
me, why do rabbits and horses have horns? Why then do oxen
and rams have no horns? Only if you can penetrate the preced­
ing story (in the case) will you realize that Hsueh Tou has a
way to help people.
Some mistakenly say, "Not saying is saying; having no
phrases is having phrases. Though rabbits and horses have no
horns, yet Hsueh Tou says they have horns. Though oxen and
rams have horns, nevertheless Hsueh Tou says they don't." But
this has nothing to do with it. They are far from knowing that
the Ancient's thousand changes and ten thousand transforma­
tions, which manifest such supernatural powers, were just to
break up the ghost cave of your spirit. If you can penetrate
through, it's not even worth using the word "understand."
Rabbits and horses have horns­
Oxen and rams have no horns.
Nary a hair, nary a wispLike mountains, like peaks.

These four lines are like the wish-fulfilling jewel. Hsueh Tou
has spit it out whole right in front of you.
The last part of the verse is all settling the case according to
the facts. "The golden relics still exist right now-with white

Case

323

foamy waves flooding the skies, where can they be put?" This
versifies the statements of Shih Shuang and Fu of T'ai Yuan.
Why is there no place to put them? "Even the one who re­
turned to the West with one shoe has lost t!lem." The sacred
tortoise is dragging his tail-this is where Hsueh Tou turns
around to help people. An Ancient said, "He just studies the
living phrase; he doesn't study the dead phrase." Since the
relics are lost, why is that bunch still struggling with each
other over them?

FIFTY-SIXTH

CASE

Ch'in Shan's One Arrowpoint
Smashes Three Barriers

POINTER

The Buddhas never appeared in the world-there is nothing to
be given to people. The Patriarch never came from the West­
he never passed on the transmission by mind. Since people of
these times do not understand, they frantically search outside
themselves. They are far from knowing that the One Great
Matter right where they are cannot be grasped even by a
thousand sages.
Right now, where do seeing and not seeing, hearing and not
hearing, speaking and not speaking, knowing and not knowing
come from? If you are unable to apprehend clearly, then try to
understand inside the cave of entangling vines.a To test, I cite
this: look!

CASE

Ch'an traveller Liang asked Ch'in Shan, "How is it when a
single arrowhead smashes three barriers?"1
Shan said, "Bring out the lord within the barriers for me to
see."2
Liang said, "So then knowing my fault I must change."3
Shan said, "Why wait any longer?"4
Liang said, "A well-shot arrow doesn't hit anywhere," and
(started to) leave.5 Shan said, "Come here a minute."6 Liang
turned his head; 7 Shan held him tight and said, "Leaving aside
for the moment a single arrowhead smashing three barriers,
let's see you shoot an arrow."8 Liang hesitated/ so Shan hit
him seven times and said, "I'll allow as this fellow will be
doubting for thirty more years."10

Fifty-sixth Case

325

NOTES
1. Danger! Undeniably Liang is extraordinary-he is a fierce general.
2. He comes on directly. He wants everyone to know; Mt. Chu is

high, Mt. An is low.
3. He sees his opportunity and acts. He's already fallen into the

secondary.
4. There's capture, there's release. When the wind moves the grass

bends.
5. After all. So Liang is trying to change his plea. He strikes his

second blow, but Ch'in Shan feels no pain.
6. Summoning him is easy, dispatching him is hard. What good is

someone who turns his head when called?
7. As it turns out Liang couldn't hold fast. He's hit.
8. Ch'in Shan lies down in the tiger's mouth. Waves against the

current. Having seen one's duty but not doing it is lack of courage.
9. As it turns out, he searches without finding. I'll hit, saying, "Too

bad."
10. The imperative must be so. There's a beginning, there's an end.

Ch'in Shan is correct at the beginning and correct at the end. It's
Ch'in Shan who should receive this beating.

COMMENTARY

Ch'an traveller Liang was undeniably a battle-tested general. In
Ch'in Shan's hand he turned to the left and revolved to the
right, bringing down his whip and flashing his stirrups. In the
end, what a pity-his bow is broken, and his arrows are used
up. Even so, "General Li Kuang, though he had a glorious repu­
tation, was never enfeoffed as a noble, so it was useless."
This public case has one exit and one entry, one capture and
one release. "Taking charge of the situation, he brings it up
face to face; face to face, taking charge of the situation is
swift." Throughout there is no falling into existence and
nonexistence or gain and loss. This is called "mysterious activ­
ity." If one lacks strength, then he will stumble.
This monk too was a brave and spirited patchrobed one; he
posed a question that really startles the crowd. Being an expert

326

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

teacher of our school, Ch'in Shan immediately knew where his
question came down. How is it when a single arrowhead
smashes the three barriers? Ch'in Shan's reply meant, "For the
moment leave aside your shooting through; try to bring out the
lord within the barriers for me to see." Liang's saying, "So then
knowing my fault I must change/' was undeniably extraordi­
nary. Ch'in Shan said, "Why wait any longer?" See how he
replied-this question of Ch'in Shan's has no gaps.
Finally Ch'an traveller Liang just said, "A well-shot arrow
doesn't hit anywhere." He shook out his sleeves to go away. As
soon as he saw him talking this way, Ch'in Shan immediately
called out to him, "Come here a minute, Reverend."b As it
turned out Liang couldn't hold fast; he turned his head back
then. Ch'in Shan held him tight and said, "Leaving aside for
the moment a single arrowhead smashing three barriers, let's
see you shoot an arrow." When Liang hesitated, Ch'in Shan
immediately struck him seven blows. After this he went on to
pronounce a curse on Liang saying, "I'll allow this fellow will
be doubting for thirty more years."
Followers of Ch'an these days all say, "Why didn't he hit
him eight times or six times? Why just seven times? Or else
why didn't he hit him immediately as he was asking him to try
to shoot an arrow?" Though this seems right, in reality it isn't.
For this case you must not cherish the least bit of rational
calculation in your heart; you must pass beyond the words.
Only then will you be able to have a way to smash the three
barriersc at a single phrase and to shoot an arrow. If you keep
thinking of right and wrong, you will never be able to get a
grasp on it.
At that time, if this monk had been a real man, Ch'in Shan
would have been in great danger too. Since Liang could not
carry out the imperative, he couldn't avoid it being carried out
on him. But say, after all, who is the lord within the barriers?
Look at Hsueh Tau's verse:

VERSE

I bring out the lord within the barriers for youOn target. Face to face, still you miss it. Retreat! Retreat!

Fifty-sixth Case

You disciples who would shoot an arrow, don't be careless!

Once dead, one doesn't come back to life again. Very
obscure. Gone by.
Take an eye and the ears go deaf;
In the left eye half a pound. Hsueh Tou lets his move go.

On the left not advancing, on the right not retreating.
Let go an ear and the eyes both go blind.
In the right eye eight ounces. There's only one road. Ad­

vance and you fall into a pit; retreat and a ferocious tiger

How is it when the entire capacity comes forth this way?
What is he saying? The barriers have been smashed, the
barriers have fallen.
The trail of the arrow is truly clear.

Dead man! Bah! I'll hit, saying, "Do you see it?"
You don't see/
A leper drags along his companions. He's creating com­

plications.
Hsuan Sha had words for this:

Who isn't Hsuan Sha?
"A great adept is the primordial ancestor of mind."

With one line he cuts off the flow and puts myriad
impulses to rest. The nostrils of the great adept are in my
hands. Before heaven and earth and the world existed,
where would you rest your body and establish your life?

COMMENTARY

Several of the lines of this verse draw on the words of a verse of
Kuei Tsung. Since Kuei Tsung made up this verse in the old
days, he was given the name Kuei Tsung ('return to the
sour ce'). Within the gate of our school this is called "talk of the
source meaning."
Later Tung An heard of this case and said, "Mr. Liang was
well able to shoot arrows, but in essence he didn't know how to

328

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

hit the target." There was a monk then who asked, "How can
one hit the target?" An said, "Who is the lord within the bar­
riers?" Later there was a monk who cited this to Ch'in Shan.
Shan said, "Even if Mr. Liang had been this way, he still
wouldn't have avoided Ch'in Shan's mouth. Although this is
so, T'ung An is not good-hearted."
Hsueh Tau says, "I bring out the lord within the barriers for
you." Open your eyes and you can see, close your eyes and you
can see too. With form, without form-all is cut into three
sections. "You disciples who would shoot an arrow, don't be
careless." If you are able to shoot well, you won't be careless. If
you don't shoot well, then it's obvious that you are careless.
"Take an eye and the ears go deaf; let go an ear and the eyes
both go blind." Tell me, when an eye is taken, why is it
nevertheless the ears that go deaf? When an ear is let go, why
then is it the eyes that both go blind? You can penetrate these
words only if you have no grasping or rejection; if you are
grasping and rejecting, then it will be impossible to see.
"I can admire a single arrowpoint smashing three barriers­
the trail of the arrow is truly clear." Ch'an traveller Liang
asked, "How is it when a single arrowpoint smashes the three
barriers?" and Ch'in Shan said, "Bring out the lord within the
barriers for me to see." These statements and everything down
to T'ung An's case at the end are all "the trail of the arrow." In
the end, what is it?"
"You don't see? Hsuan Sha had words for this: 'A great adept
is the primordial ancestor of mind.' " It is commonplace to
take mind as the ultimate principle of the school of the Pa­
triarchs; here though, why is the great adept still the ancestor
of this mind even before heaven and earth were born? If you
can thoroughly understand this time and season, only then
will you be able to recognize the lord within the barriers.
"The trail of the arrow is truly clear." If you want to hit the
target, there clearly is a trail behind the arrow. But say, what is
the trail behind the arrow? Before you'll understand, you must
apply concentrated mental effort on your own.
"A great adept is the primordial ancestor of mind." Hsuan
Sha often taught his community with these words. This is
from a verse of Kuei Tsung's which Hsueh Tau has wrongly
attributed to Hsuan Sha. Students of today who take this mind
as the ancestral source can study until Maitreya Buddha comes

Fifty-sixth Case

329

down to be born here and still never understand. For one who is
a great adept, even mind is still just the descendant.
"Heaven and earth not yet distinct" is already the second­
ary. Tell me, at just such a time, what is "before heaven and
earth"?

TRANSLATORS NOTES

a.

Tangled or entangling vines is an expression colloquially meaning
complications, and has been so translated. In Ch'an talk it is often
used on one level to refer specifically to words, hence the public
cases

b.

(kung an) themselves.

"Reverend" used here was used sometimes by Ch'an teachers as a
term of direct address, hence is not always necessary to translate,
except for emphasis. In formal usage it really means teacher, so it
is possible that there can be some irony in the Ch'an usage. The
original Sanskrit word,

Acarya, was transliterated into Chinese

syllables instead of semantic translation; the connotations of
teacher, exemplar, and guide tended in common usage to fade into
a general term of respect.
c.

Nothing is specifically said about what the three barriers are;
since the point seems to be the lord within the barriers, perhaps it
is pointless to say anything. The form of Liang's question need
not be considered totally arbitrary, however; we have seen men­
tion, for example, of Yun Men's three phrases within a phrase,
cutting off the stream, covering heaven and earth, and going along
with the waves. Pai Chang said that the Buddhist Teachings all
had three phases (expressed verbally and metaphorically as
phrases): detachment from everything, not abiding in detachment
(not seeing that there is anything really real to either grasp or
reject), and not having any understanding of non-abiding (no
awareness of knowledge of non-duality as such, no more delusion
of subtle and extremely subtle knowledge). In the Lin Chi Ch'an
school of the Southern Sung dynasty, after Yuan Wu, when the
use of kung

an as meditation themes was popular, there also was
an; seeing its

reference to three phases of "understanding" a kung

intent, practical application, and transcendance. All of these des­
ignated states of attainment could be called "barriers"; probably
"three barriers" means all barriers.

like an iron wall. When you have been able to penetrate, from
the beginning it was your self that was the silver mountain, the
iron wall.
If someone asks me, "So what?" I would just say to him,
"Here, if you can reveal an action and observe an environment,
occupy the essential bridge without letting profane or holy
pass, this would not be beyond your inherent capacity."
If, on the other hand, you are not yet thus, observe the look
of an Ancient.

CASE

A monk asked Chao Chou, " 'The Ultimate Path has no
difficulties-just avoid picking and choosing.' What is not
picking and choosing?"1
Chou said, " 'In the heavens and on earth I alone am the
Honored One.'

"2

The monk said, "This is still picking and choosing."3
Chou said, "Stupid oaf! Where is the picking and choos­
ing? "4 The monk was speechless. 5

COMMENTARY

The monk questioned Chao Chou about (the saying) "The Ul­
timate Path has no difficulties-just avoid picking and choos­
ing." The Third Patriarch's Inscription of the Believing Heart
starts off directly with these two lines. There are quite a few
people who misunderstand. How so? (According to them,) the
Ultimate Path is fundamentally without difficulties, but also
without anything that's not difficult; it's just that it's only
adverse to picking and choosing. If you understand in this fash­
ion, in ten thousand years you won't even see it in dreams.
Chao Chou often used this saying to question people. This
monk reversed this by taking this saying to question him. If
you look to the words, then this monk does after all startle
heaven and shake the earth. If it is not in the words, then what?
You must be able to turn this little key before it will open. To
grab the tiger's whiskers, you must be able to do it on your own
abilities. Heedless of the mortal danger, this monk dared to
grab the tiger's whiskers, so he said, "This is still picking and
choosing." Chao Chou immediately blocked off his mouth by
saying, "Stupid oaf! Where is the picking and choosing?" If the
monk had asked someone else, he would have seen him flus­
tered and confused. But what could he do about this old fellow
who was an adept? Chao Chou moved where it was impossible
to move, turned around where it was impossible to tum
around.
If you can penetrate all evil and poisonous words and
phrases, even down to a thousand differences and ten thousand
forms, then all conventional fabrications will be the excellent
flavor of purified ghee. If you can get to where you touch real­
ity, then you will see Chao Chou's naked heart in its entirety.
"Stupid oaf" is a country expression of the people of Fu
Chou, to revile people for being without intelligence. When the
monk said, "This is still picking and choosing," Chao Chou
said, "Stupid oaf! Where is the picking and choosing?" The eye

of teachers of our school must be thus, like the golden winged
Garuda bird parting the ocean waters to seize a dragon directly

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tau explains Chao Chou's two lines in the case by
saying, "Deep as the ocean, firm as a mountain." The monk
said, "This is still picking and choosing," so Hsueh Tau says
that this monk is just like a mosquito playing in a gale, like an
ant trying to shake an iron pillar. Hsueh Tau praises this
monk's great bravery. Why? This "the ultimate path has no
difficulties" is something superior people use, yet this monk
dared to talk in this way. Chao Chou did not let him go; he
immediately said, "Stupid oaf! Where is the picking and choos­
ing?" Isn't this a fierce wind, an iron pillar?

Fifty-seventh Case

333

"Picking, choosing-a cloth drum hung under the eaves."
At the end Hsueh Tou picks this up to bring you to life. If you
recognize it clearly, then you are carrying the whole thing
yourself. What's the reason? Haven't you heard it said that if
you want to attain intimate understanding, don't use a ques­
tion to ask. That is why "the cloth drum under the eaves".

TRANSLATORS' NOTES

a.

A cloth drum makes no sound when beaten; just so, Tenkei ex­

plains, asking questions ('beating the drum') will never yield the
real answer. Ultimately all discrimination, even between dis­
crimination and clarity, is beating a cloth drum; the sound disap­
pears in the emptiness of space.

FIFTY-EIGHTH CASE

Chao Chou Can't Explain

CASE

A monk asked Chao Chou, " 'The Ultimate Path has no
difficulties-just avoid picking and choosing'-isn't this a
cliche for people of these times?"1
Chou said, "Once someone asked me, and I really couldn't
explain for five years."2

NOTES

1.

A double case. This too is a point which makes people doubt.

Treading on a scale beam, hard as iron. There's still this one.
Don't judge others on the basis of yourself.
2.

Honest speech is better than a red face. A monkey eats a caterpil­
lar, a mosquito bites an iron ox.

COMMENTARY

Chao Chou usually didn't use blows or shouts; his action went
beyond blows and shouts. This monk's question was also very
special; it would have been hard for anyone but Chao Chou to
answer him. Since Chao Chou was an adept, he just said to
him, "Once someone asked me, and I really couldn't explain
for five years." The question towered up like a mile-high wall,
and the answer didn't make light of it. Just understand it this
way and it's right here. If you don't understand, then don't
make rational calculations.
Haven't you heard how when the man of the Path Tsung of
T'ou Tzu was the scribe in Hsueh Tau's community, Hsueh
Tau had him immerse himself in "The Ultimate Path has no
difficulties; just avoid picking and choosing." Thereby Tsung
had an awakening. One day Hsueh Tau asked him, "What is

334

Fifty-eighth Case

335

the meaning of 'The Ultimate Path has no difficulties; just
avoid picking and choosing'?" Tsung said, "Animal, animal."
Later he dwelt in seclusion on Mt. T'ou Tzu. Whenever he
went to serve as an abbot, he wrapped his straw sandals and his
scriptural texts in his robe. A monk asked him "What is your
family style, Wayfarer?" Tsung said, "Straw sandals wrapped
in a robe." The monk said, "What does this mean?" Tsung said,
"T'ung Ch'eng (the neighboring city) is under my bare feet."
Thus it is said, "Making offerings to the Buddha is not a
matter of a lot of incense." If you can penetrate through and
escape, then letting go or holding on rest with oneself. Since
this case is one question and one answer, clear and perfectly
obvious, why then did Chao Chou say that he couldn't explain?
But tell me, is this a cliche for people of these times or not? Did
Chao Chou answer him inside or outside the nest of cliche.a
You must realize that this matter isn't in words and phrases. If
there's a fellow who penetrates the bone and penetrates the
marrow, whose faith is thoroughgoing, then he's like a dragon
reaching the water, like a tiger taking to the mountains.

couldn't explain for five years." This is like "The Elephant

people's mouths. South, north, east, west-the raven flies, the
rabbit runs." If Hsueh Tou didn't have the last word, where
else would he have come from? Since "the raven flies, the
rabbit runs,"b tell me, where do Chao Chou, Hsueh Tou, and I
end up?

NOTES

In literary Chinese, the word 'nest' is used to refer to a cliche; that

is, something people stick to. It is used in the same way in Ch'an
to refer to words and sayings which have become cliche, and
generally to any rut or habit in which one 'nests' complacently,
any point on which one depends.

The raven and rabbit also refer to the sun and moon; their flight is

Chao Chou's Why Not Quote It

POINTER

points out the wondrous mind of nirvana; within the forest of
shields and spears he decisively establishes the lifeline of
patchrobed monks.
But tell me, endowed with whose power, can one get to be
this way? As a test I cite this: look!

CASE

A monk asked Chao Chou, " 'The Ultimate Path has no
difficulties-just avoid picking and choosing.1 As soon as there
are words and speech, this is picking and choosing.'2 So how do
you help people, Teacher? "3

In the end it's up to this old fellow. The monk has his eyes

snatched away; he's been overtaken.

COMMENTARY

Chao Chou saying, "It's just this: 'The Ultimate Path has no
difficulties-just avoid picking and choosing,' " is like a
stone-struck spark, like a flash of lightning. Capturing and re­
leasing, killing and giving life-he has such independent mas­
tery. All over they said that Chao Chou had eloquence beyond
the common crowd.
Chao Chou often taught his community with this speech,
saying, "The Ultimate Path has no difficulties-just avoid
picking and choosing. As soon as there are words and speech,
'this is picking and choosing,' 'this is clarity.' This old monk
does not abide within clarity; do you still preserve anything or
not?" Once there was a monk who asked, "Since you do not
abide in clarity, what is to be preserved?" Chou said, "I don't
know either." The monk said, "Since you don't know,
Teacher, why do you say you don't abide in clarity?" Chou
said, "It's enough just to ask about this matter. Now bow and
withdraw."
Later a monk picked on his gap and went to question him;
this monk's questioning was undeniably extraordinary, but
nevertheless it was just mental activity. Someone other than
Chao Chou would have been unable to handle this monk. But
what could he do? Chao Chou was an adept and immediately
said, "Why don't you quote this saying in full?"
This monk too understood how to turn himself around and
show his mettle; he said, "I only remember up to here." It
seems just like an arrangement. Directly after the monk spoke,
Chao Chou immediately answered him; he didn't need any
calculations. An Ancient said of this, "Continuity is indeed
very difficult." Chao Chou distinguished dragons from snakes
and differentiated right from wrong; this goes back to his being
an adept in his own right. Chao Chou snatched this monk's
eyes away without running afoul of his sharp point. Without
relying on calculations, he was spontaneously exactly appro­
priate.

Fifty-ninth Case

339

It's wrong to say either that he had words or didn't have
words; nor will it do to say that his answer neither had nor
didn't have words. Chao Chou left behind all the permutations
of logic. Why? If one discusses this matter, it is like sparks
struck from stone, like flashing lightning. Only if you set your
eyes on it quickly can you see it. If you hesitate and vascillate
you won't avoid losing your body and life.

VERSE

Water poured on cannot wet,
What are you saying? Too deep and far off. What is there
to discuss?
Wind blowing cannot enter.
It's like empty space. Hard, impervious. Address your plea
to the sky.
The tiger prowls, the dragon walks;
He gains independence; he's outstanding.
Ghosts howl, spirits wail.
Everyone cover your ears! When the wind moves, the
grasses bow. Are you not a fellow-student of theirs, Rev­
erend?
His head is three feet long-! wonder who it is!
A strange being. A sage from where? Do you see? Do you
see?
Standing on one foot, he answers back without speaking.
Bah! He draws back his head and lets his move go. Moun­
tain ghost? He shouldn't be let go, so I strike.

COMMENTARY

"Water poured on cannot wet, wind blowing cannot enter. The
tiger prowls, the dragon walks; ghosts howl, spirits wail."
There's no place for you to chew on. These four lines versify

tion. Not only this monk; even the ghosts howl, even the
spirits wail. It's like when the wind moves, the grasses bow
down.
Of the final two lines, it could be said, "One son has inti­
mately understood." "His head is three feet long-I wonder
who it is? Standing on one foot, he answers back without
speaking." Haven't you heard how a monk asked an Ancient
Worthy, "What is the Buddha?" The Ancient Worthy said,
"His head is three feet long, his neck two inches long." Hsueh
Tau draws on this to use in the verse. I wonder, do you people
recognize him? Not even I know him. All at once Hsueh Tau
has fully depicted Chao Chou. The real one has always been
within: all of you must investigate carefully and try to see it.

Yun Men's Staff Changes into a

Dragon

POINTER

Buddhas and sentient beings-fundamentally there is no dif­
ference between them. Mountains and rivers and one's own
self-how could there be any distinction? Why then is it all
divided into two sides?
Even if you can set words turning and occupy the essential
bridge, it still won't do to let go. If you don't let go, the whole
great earth isn't worth grasping. But what is the place to set
words turning? To test, I cite this: look!

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

As for Yun Men's saying, "The staff has changed into a dragon
and swallowed the universe. Where are the mountains, rivers,
and earth to be found?" If you say it exists, then you are blind;
if you say it doesn't exist, then you are dead. Do you see where
Yun Men helped people? Bring the staff back to me!
People these days do not understand where Yun Men stood
alone and revealed. Instead they say that he went to form to
explain mind, that he relied on things to reveal principle. But
old Shakyamuni couldn't have not known this theory as he
taught the Dharma for forty-nine years; why then did he also
need to hold up the flower for Kashyapa's smile? This old fel­
low caused confusion saying, "I have the treasury of the eye of
the correct teaching, the wondrous mind of nirvana-these I
pass on to MahaKashyapa." Why was there still a need for the
specially transmitted mind seal? Given that all of you are
guests in the house of the ancestral teachers, do you under­
stand this specially transmitted mind?
If there is a single thing in your breast, then mountains,
rivers, and the great earth appear in profusion before you; if
there isn't a single thing in your breast, then outside there is
not so much as a fine hair. How can you talk about principle
and knowledge fusing, about objective world and mind merg­
ing? What's the reason? When one is understood, all are under­
stood; when one is clear, all are clear.
Ch'ang Sha said, "People studying the Path don't know the
real, because they've always given recognition to their cogniz­
ing mind; this, the basis of countless aeons of births and
deaths, fools call the original person." If you suddenly smash
the shadowy world of the heaps and elements of life so that
body and mind are one likeness and there is nothing else out­
side your body, you still haven't attained the other half. How
can you talk about going to form to reveal the mind, using
things to demonstrate principle?
An Ancient said,

As soon as one atom of dust arises, the

,,

whole world is contained therein." But say, which atom of dust
is this? If you can know this atom of dust, then you can know
the staff. As soon as Yun Men picks up his staff, we im­
mediately see his unconfined marvelous activity. Such talk is

Sixtieth Case

343

already a mass of entangling vines, complications; how much
the more so is transforming the staff into a dragon! Librarian
Ch'ing said, "Has there ever been such talk in the five
thousand and forty-eight volumes of the canon?" Every time he
turned to his staff, Yun Men brought out the great function of
his whole capacity and helped people in a way that was leaping
with life.
Pa Chiao said, "If you have a staff, I'll give you a staff; if you
have no staff, I'll take your staff away."
Yung Chia said, "This is not an empty exhibition displaying
form; it is the actual traces of the Tathagata's precious staff."
Long ago in the time of Diparnkara Buddha, the (future)
Tathagata (Shakyamuni) spread his hair to cover some mud for
that Buddha. Dipamkara said, "A temple should be built here."
Also present then was an elder who thereupon set up a blade of
grass right there and said, "The temple has been built." All of
you tell me, where is this scene to be found?
The ancestral teacher Hsueh Tau said, "At a blow, experi­
ence it; at a shout, receive it rightly." But tell me, receive what
rightly? Supposing there's someone who asks, "What is the
staff?" Shouldn't you tum a backflip? Shouldn't you clap your
hands? All of this would be giving play to your spirits, and has
nothing to do with it.

VERSE

The staff swallows the universe-

What is he saying? The staff is only used for beating dogs.
He vainly talks of peach blossoms floating on the rushing

Make an opening upwards and all the thousand sages will

times isn't as good as catching it in your hand once.

COMMENTARY

Yun Men helps people by a circuitous path; Hsueh Tou helps
people by a direct shortcut. That's why Hsueh Tou discards the
transformation into a dragon; he doesn't need such talk, just
"the staff swallows the universe." Hsueh Tou's great intent is
to have people avoid fanciful interpretations. He goes on to say,

Sixtieth Case

345

"He vainly talks of peach blossoms floating on the rushing
waves." There's no further need for transformations into dra­
gons. At the Gate of Yu there's a three-level rapidsi every year
by the third month when the peach blossoms bloom and the
waves rise, those fish who can go against the current and leap
past the rapids change into dragons. Hsueh Tou says even
though they change into dragons, this too is still vain talk.
"For those with tails burnt off it's not a matter of grasping
clouds and seizing fog." When fish pass through the Gate of Yu
a celestial fire bums their tailsi they grab the clouds, seize the
fog, and depart. Hsueh Tou means that though they change
into dragons, it still isn't a matter of grabbing clouds and seiz­
ing fog. "Why should the exhausted ones necessarily lose their
courage and spirit?" The introduction to Ch'ing Liang's com­
mentary on the Avatamsaka scripture says, "Even bodhisattvas
who have accumulated virtuous conduct gasp for breath at the
Gate of Yu." His overall meaning is to explain that the realm of
the Avatamsaka Flower Garland Cosmosa is not something
mastered by small virtue or small knowledgei it's like the fish
trying to pass through the Dragon Gate of Yu, where those who
cannot pass through fail and fall back. They lie in the sand
shoals of the dead water, exhausted and gasping. Hsueh Tou
means that once they fail and fall back, they always lose their
courage and spirit.
"I have picked it up-do you hear or not?" Again he adds
footnotesi all at once he's swept it clean for you. All of you
"simply must be completely free and at ease-stop any further
mixed up confusion." If you go on with mixed up confusion,
you have lost the staff.
"With seventy-two blows I'm still letting you off easy­
even with a hundred and fifty it's hard to forgive you." Why
has Hsueh Tou discarded the heavy for the light? An Ancient
said, "Seventy-two blows doubled makes one hundred and
fifty." These days people misunderstand and just calculate
numerically and say, "It should be seventy-five blowsi why is
it instead just seventy-two blows?" How far they are from
knowing that the Ancient's meaning was beyond the words.
Thus it is said, "This matter is not in words and phrases."
Hsueh Tou drew on this to use in order to avoid people later on
trying to rationalize. Even if you're truly free and at ease, you
still rightly deserve to be given seventy-two blows-this is still

346

letting you off easy. Even if you're not free and at ease like this
at all, it would be hard to let you go with one hundred and fifty.
Hsueh Tou had completed his verse all at once, yet he
picked up his staff again to help some more. Nevertheless,
there wasn't even one with blood under his skin.

TRANSLATORS NOTES

a.

The Avatamsaka (Hua-Yen, Kegon) scripture is a major Greater
Vehicle Buddhist scripture. The name, which means flower gar­
land or ornament, refers to myriad religious practices, likened to
flowers, adorning the realm which is produced as a result of prac­
tices in the causal state. It also refers to the representation of
myriad qualities and states of being 'adorning' the worlds and
universes of the cosmos. In this cosmos, all realms contain infi­
nite realms, ad infinitum, all mutually reflecting and dependent
on each other and a moment of thought. Many Ch'an masters
were familiar with the Avatamsaka scripture; Tsung-mi, a suc­
cessor of the Ho-tse line of Southern Ch'an, was also considered
the Fifth Patriarch of the Hua-Yen school of Buddhism in China.

To set up the Banner of the Teaching and establish its funda­

To judge dragons and snakes, distinguish the initiate from the

appropriate for the moment with a staff, this I leave aside for
the moment; just tell me in one phrase how you will assess the
matter of occupying the heartland singlehandedly. To test, I

to accomplish it. But do you know? If you know, I admit that you
are autonomous and free. If you do not know, you get hit three
thousand times in the morning, eight hundred times in the eve­
ning.

COMMENTARY

As Feng Hsueh said to his assembly, "If you set up a single
atom of dust, the nation flourishes; if you don't set up a single
atom of dust, the nation perishes." Now tell me, is it right to
set up an atom of dust, or is it right not to set up an atom of
dust? When you get here, your great function must become
manifest before you'll understand. That is why (Feng Hsueh)
said, "Even if you can grasp it before it is spoken of, still this is
remaining in the shell, wandering in limitation; even if you
thoroughly penetrate it at a single phrase, you still won't avoid
insane views on the way."
He was a venerable adept in the lineage of Lin Chi; he di­
rectly used his own provisions; "If you set up a single atom of
dust, the nation flourishes, and the old peasants frown." The
meaning lies in the fact that to establish a nation and stabilize
the country, it is necessary to rely on crafty ministers and
valiant generals; after that, the Unicorn appears, the Pheonix
soars-these are the auspicious signs of great peace. How could
the people of three-family villages know there are such things?
When you do not set up a single atom of dust, the nation
perishes, the wind blows chill; why do the old peasants come
out and sing hallelujah? Just because the nation has perished.
In the (Ts'ao-) Tung lineage, they call this the point of trans­

formation: there is no more Buddha, nor sentient beings; no
affirmation, no negation, no good, no bad-it is beyond sound
and echo, track or trace. That is why it is said, "Although gold
dust is precious, in the eye it obstructs vision."b And it is said,
"Gold dust is a cataract on the eye; the jewel in one's robe is
the defilement of the Dharma.c Even one's own spirit is not
important; who are the Buddhas and Patriarchs?" Piercing and
penetrating supernatural powers and their wondrous action
would not be considered exceptional; when he gets here, with

his patched robe covering his head, myriad concerns cease-at
this time, the mountain monk does not understand anything at
all. If one were to speak any more of mind, speak of nature,
speak of the profound, speak of the wondrous, it would not be
any use at all. What is the reason? "He has his own mountain
spirit realm."
Nan Ch'uan said to his community, "The seven hundred
eminent monks on Huang Mei were all men who understood
the Buddha Dharma. They did not get his Robe and Bowl; there
was only workman Lu who did not understand the Buddha
Dharma-that is why he got his robe and bowl."d
He also said, "The Buddhas of the past, present, and future
do not know what is; but cats and oxen do know what is." The
old peasants either frown or sing, but tell me how you will
understand? And tell me, what eye do they possess, that they
are like this? You should know that in front of the old peasants'
gates no ordinances are posted.
Hsueh Tou, having raised both sides, finally lifts up his staff
and says, "Are there any patchrobed monks who will live to­
gether and die together?" At that time, if there had been a
fellow who could come forth and utter a phrase, alternately
acting as guest and host, he would have avoided this old fellow
Hsueh Tou's pointing to himself in the end.

VERSE

The old peasants may not unfurrow their brows,
There is someone three thousand miles away. Delicious
food is not for a satisfied man to eat.
But for now I hope that the nation establishes a sturdy foundation.
The one song of great peace, everyone knows. When you
want to go, go; when you want to stay, stay. Heaven,
earth, the whole world is one gate of liberation. How will
you establish it?
Crafty ministers, valiant generals-where are they now?
Are there any? Are there? The land is broad, the people are
few, and rarely is anyone met with. But do not point to
yourself.

COMMENTARY

Previously he quoted both sides; here, instead, he just raises
one side and lets the other go. He cuts down the long and adds
to the short, abandons the heavy and goes along with the light.
That is why he says, "The old peasants may not unfurrow their
brows, but for now I hope the nation establishes a sturdy foun­
dation; where are the crafty ministers and valiant generals
now?" When Hsueh Tau lifted up his staff and said, "Aie there
any patchrobed monks who will live together and die to­
gether?" This was just like saying, "Aie there still any crafty
ministers and valiant generals?" In one gulp he has swallowed
everyone completely. That is why I say that the land is broad,
the people few, and rarely is anyone met with. Aie there any
who know? Come forth and be buried in the same pit. "Ten
thousand miles' pure wind, only I know." This is where Hsueh
Tau points to himself.

By means of the knowledge that has no teacher, he produces

COMMENTARY

Yun Men says, "Within heaven and earth, through space and
time, there is a jewel, hidden in the mountain of form." Now
352

Sixty-second Case

353

tell me, is Yun Men's meaning in the "fishing pole,"b or is the
meaning in the lamp? These lines are paraphrased from a
treatise of Seng Chao, Master of the Teachings, called Jewel
Treasury; Yun Men brought them up to teach his community.
In the time of the Latter Ch'in, Seng Chao was in the Garden
of Freedom composing his treatise. When he was copying the
old Vimalakirtinirdesa scripture he realized that Chuang-tzu
and Lao-tzu had still not exhausted the marvel; Chao then paid
obeisance to Kumarajiva as his teacher. He also called on the
bodhisattva Buddhabhadra at the Tile Coffin Temple, who had
transmitted the Mind Seal from the Twenty-seventh Patriarch
(Prajnatara) in India. Chao entered deeply into the inner
sanctum. One day Chao ran into trouble; when he was about to
be executed, he asked for seven days' reprieve, during which
time he composed the treatise Jewel Treasury.
So Yun Men cited four phrases from that treatise to teach his
community. The main idea is "how can you take a priceless
jewel and conceal it in the heaps and elements?" The words
spoken in the treatise are all in accord with the talk of our
school. Have you not seen how Ching Ch'ing asked Ts'ao Shan,
"How is it when in the principle of pure emptiness ultimately
there is no body?" Ts'ao Shan said, "The principle being like
this, what about phenomena?" Ch'ing said, "As is principle, so
are phenomena." Shan said, "You can fool me, one person, but
what can you do about the eyes of all the sages?" Ch'ing said,
"Without the eyes of all the sages, how could you know it is
not so?" Shan said, "Officially, not even a needle is admitted;
privately, even a cart and horse can pass."
That is why it was said, "Within heaven and earth, in space
and time, there is a jewel, hidden in the mountain of form."
The great meaning of this is to show that everyone is fully
endowed, each individual is perfectly complete. Yun Men thus
brought it up to show his community; it is totally obvious-he
couldn't go on and add interpretations for you like a lecturer.
But he is compassionate and adds a footnote for you, saying,
"Pick up a lamp and go into the Buddha-hall; bring the triple
gate on the lamp."
Now tell me, when Yun Men speaks this way, what is his
meaning? Have you not seen how an Ancient said, "The true
nature of ignorance is identical to Buddhahood; the empty
body of illusion is identical to the body of reality." It is also
said, "See the Buddha mind right in the ordinary mind."

354

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

The "mountain of form" is the four gross elements and five
heaps (which constitute human life).c "Within there is a jewel,
hidden in the mountain of form." That is why it is said, "All
Buddhas are in the mind; deluded people go seeking outside.
Though within they embosom a priceless jewel, they do not
know it, and let it rest there all their lives." It is also said, "The
Buddha-nature clearly manifests, but the sentient beings dwel­
ling in form hardly see it. If one realizes that sentient beings
have no self, how does his own face differ from a Buddha's
face?" "The mind is the original mind; the face is the face hom
of woman-the Rock of Ages may be moved, but here there is
no change."
Some people acknowledge this radiant shining spirituality
as the jewel; but they cannot make use of it, and they do not
realize its wondrousness. Therefore they cannot set it in mo­
tion and cannot bring it out in action. An Ancient said,
"Reaching an impasse, then change; having changed, then you
can pass through."
"Pick up a lamp and head into the Buddha-hall"; if it is a
matter of ordinary sense, this can be fathomed-but can you
fathom "bring the triple gate on the lamp"? Yun Men has bro­
ken up emotional discrimination, intellectual ideas, gain, loss,
affirmation, and negation, all at once for you. Hsueh Tou has
said, "I like the freshly established devices of Shao Yang (Yun
Men); all his life he pulled out nails and drew out pegs for
others." He also said, "I do not know how many sit on the chair
of rank; but the sharp sword cutting away causes others' admi­
ration." When he said, "Pick up a lamp and go into the
Buddha-hall," this one phrase has already cut off completely;
yet, "bring the triple gate on the lamp." If you discuss this
matter, it is like sparks struck from stone, like the flash of a
lightning bolt. Yun Men said, "If you would attain, just seek a
way of entry; Buddhas numerous as atoms are under your feet,
the three treasuries of the holy teachings are on your tongues;
(but) this is not as good as being enlightened. Monks, do not
think falsely; sky is sky, earth is earth, mountains are moun­
tains, rivers are rivers, monks are monks, lay people are lay
people." After a long pause he said, "Bring me the immovable
mountain before you." Then a monk came forth and asked,
"How is it when a student sees that mountains are mountains
and rivers are rivers?" Yun Men drew a line with his hand and

Sixty-second Case

355

said, "Why is the triple gate going from here?" He feared you
would die, so he said, "When you know, it is the superb flavor
of ghee; if you do not know, instead it becomes poison."
This is why it is said, "When completely thoroughly under­
stood, there is nothing to understand; the most abstruse pro­
fundity of the mystery is still to be scorned."
Hsueh Tou again brought it up and said, "Within heaven and
earth, through space and time, therein is a jewel; it lies hidden
in the mountain of form. It is hung on a wall; for nine years
Bodhidharma did not dare to look at it straight on. If any patch­
robed monk wants to see it now, I will hit him right on the
spine with my staff."ct See how these self-possessed teachers of
our school never use any actual doctrine to tie people up.
Hsuan Sha said, "Though you try to enmesh him in a trap, he
doesn't consent to stay; though you call after him, he doesn't
tum his head. Even though he is like this, still he is a sacred
tortoise dragging his tail."

VERSE

Look! Look!
Set your eyes on high. Why look? A black dragon admires
a gem.
On the ancient embankment, who holds the fishing pole?
Alone, quite alone; stolid, quite stolid. Hsueh Tou draws
his bow after the thief has gone. If you see jowls on the
back of someone's head, don't have anything to do with
him.
Clouds roll on.
Cut them off. A hundred layers, a thousand levels. A
greasy hat and stinking shirt.
The water, vast and boundlessLeft and right it goes, blocking in front and supporting in
back.
The white flowers in the moonlight, you must see for yourself.
When you see them, you'll go blind. If you can com­
prehend Yun Men's words, then you will see Hsueh Tau's
last phrase.

356

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

If you can comprehend Yun Men's words, then you will see
how Hsueh Tou helps people. He goes to the last two phrases of
Yun Men's address to the community and there gives you a
footnote saying, "Look! Look!" If you thereupon make raising
your eyebrows and glinting your eyes your understanding, • you
are out of touch.
An Ancient said, "The spiritual light shines alone, far trans­
cending the senses; the essential substance is manifest, real
and eternal. It is not captured in written letters. The nature of
mind has no defilement; it is basically naturally perfectly
complete. Just get rid of delusive clingings and merge with the
Buddha that is as is." If you just go to raising your eyebrows
and glinting your eyes and sit there forever, how will you be
able to transcend the senses?
Hsueh Tou is saying, "Look! Look!" Yun Men appears to be
on an ancient embankment holding a fishing pole; the clouds
are rolling and the water is vast and boundless. The bright
moon reflects white flowers, and white flowers reflect the
bright moon. At this moment, tell me, what realm is this? If
you can perceive it immediately and directly, the former and
the latter phrases are just like one phrase.

NOTES

The triple gate is the main gate of a monastery; usually it com­
prises three gates, hence the name, but it is called the triple gate
even if there is only one. It is also called the "mountain gate,"
since monasteries were referred to as "mountains" even if they
were not actually so situated. Many Ch'an monasteries, espe­
cially in the earlier days, were actually in the mountains, hence
the name.

b.

See Hsueh Tau's verse; Yun Men's saying is likened to a "fishing
pole." The idea of "fishing" as one of the strategies of a teaching
Ch'an master has been met with several times in this book.

c.

The four gross elements are earth, air, fire, and water; the five
heaps are form, sensation, perception, synergies, and conscious­
ness. These classifications represent the elements of existence in
general, of human life in particular. The analysis of the human

no individual self-subsistent entity.

SIXTY-THIRD CASE

Nan Ch'uan Kills

a

Cat

POINTER

Where the road of ideation cannot reach, that is just right to
bring to attention; where verbal explanation cannot reach, you
must set your eyes on it quickly. If your thunder rolls and
comets fly, then you can overturn lakes and topple mountains.
Is there anyone in the crowd who can manage this? To test, I
cite this to see.

CASE

At Nan Ch'uan's place one day the (monks of) the eastern and
western halls were arguing about a cat.1 When Nan Ch'uan saw
this, he then held up the cat and said, "If you can speak, then I
will not kill it."2 No one in the community replied;3 Nan
Ch'uan cut the cat into two pieces.4

NOTES

1.

It's not just today that they're haggling together. This is a case of
degeneracy.

2.

When the true imperative goes into effect, the ten directions are
subdued. This old fellow has the capability to distinguish dragons
from snakes.

3.

What a pity to let him go. A bunch of lacquer tubs-what are they
worth? Phoney Ch'an followers are as plentiful as hemp and mil­
let.

4.

How quick! How quick! If he hadn't acted like this, they would
all be fellows playing with a mud ball. He draws the bow after the
thief has gone. Already this is secondary; he should have been hit
before he even picked it up.

Sixty-third Case

COMMENTARY

An accomplished master of our school: see his movement,
stillness, his going out and entering in. Tell me, what was his
inner meaning? This story about killing the cat is widely dis­
cussed in monasteries everywhere. Some say that the holding
up is it; some say it lies in the cutting. But actually these bear
no relation to it at all. If he had not held it up, then would you
still spin out all sorts of rationalizations? You are far from
knowing that this Ancient had the eye to judge heaven and
earth, and he had the sword to settle heaven and earth.
Now you tell me, after all, who was it that killed the cat?
Just when Nan Ch'uan held it up and said, "If you can speak,
then I won't kill it," at that moment, if there were suddenly
someone who could speak, tell me, would Nan Ch'uan have
killed it or not? This is why I say, "When the true imperative
goes into effect, the ten directions are subdued." Stick your
head out beyond the heavens and look; who's there?
The fact is that at that time he really did not kill. This story
does not lie in killing or not_killing. This matter is clearly
known; it is so distinctly clear. It is not to be found in emo­
tions or opinions; if you go searching in emotions and opin­
ions, then you tum against Nan Ch'uan. Just see it right on the
edge of the knife. If it exists, all right; if it does not exist, all
right; if it neither exists nor doesn't exist, that is all right too.
That is why an Ancient said, "When at an impasse, change;
when you change, then you can pass through." People nowa­
days do not know how to change and pass through; they only
go running to the spoken words. When Nan Ch'uan held up
(the cat) in this way, he could not have been telling people they
should be able to say something; he just wanted people to
attain on their own, each act on their own, and know for them­
selves. If you do not understand it in this way, after all you will
grope without finding it. Hsueh Tou versifies it directly:

VERSE

In both halls they are phoney Ch'an followers:

Familiar words come from a familiar mouth. With one
phrase he has said it all. He settles the case according to
the facts.

360

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Stirring up smoke and dust, they are helpless.
Look; what settlement will you make? A completely ob­
vious public case. Still there's something here.
Fortunately, there is Nan Ch'uan, who is able to uphold the
command:
Raising my whisk, I say, "It's just like this." Old Master
Wang (Nan Ch'uan) amounts to something. He uses the
fine jewel-sword of the Diamond King to cut mud.
With one stroke of the knife he cuts into two pieces, letting
them be lopsided as they may.
Shattered into a hundred fragments. If someone should
suddenly hold his knife still, see what he would do. He
can't be let go, so I strike!

COMMENTARY

"In both halls they are phoney Ch'an followers." Hsueh Tou
does not die at the phrase, and he also does not acknowledge
that which is ahead of a donkey but behind a horse. He has a
place to tum, so he says, "Stirring up smoke and dust, they are
helpless." Hsueh Tou and Nan Ch'uan walk hand in hand; in
one phrase he has said it all. The leaders of the two halls have
no place to rest their heads; everywhere they go, they just stir
up smoke and dust, unable to accomplish anything. Fortu­
nately there is Nan Ch'uan to settle this public case for them,
and he wraps it up cleanly and thoroughly. But what can be
done for them, who neither reached home nor got to the shop?
That is why he said, "Fortunately there is Nan Ch'uan, who is
able to uphold the command; with one stroke of the knife he
cuts into two pieces, letting them be lopsided as they may." He
directly cuts in two with one knife, without further concern as
to whether they'll be unevenly lopsided. But tell me, what
command is Nan Ch'uan enforcing?

SIXTY-FOURTH CASE

Nan Ch'uan Questions Chao Chou

CASE

Nan Ch'uan recited the preceding story to question Chao
Chou.1 Chou immediately took off his straw sandals, placed
them on his head, and left.2 Nan Ch'uan said, "If you had been
here, you could have saved the cat."3

NOTES

1.

They must be of like hearts and like minds before this is possible.

2.

He does not avoid trailing mud and dripping water.

Only one on the same road would know.
3.

Singing and clapping, they accompany each other; those who
know the tune are few. He adds error to error.

COMMENTARY

Chao Chou was Nan Ch'uan's true heir; when Nan Ch'uan
spoke of the head, Chao Chou understood the tail; when it is
brought up, he immediately knows where it comes down.
In the evening Nan Ch'uan repeated the preceding story and
asked Chao Chou about it. Chou was an old adept; he im­
mediately took off his straw sandals, put them on his head, and
left. Ch'uan said, "If you had been here, you could have saved
the cat." But tell me, was it really like this or not? Nan Ch'uan
said, "If you can speak, then I won't kill it." Like a flint-struck
spark, like a flash of lightning. Chao Chou immediately took
off his sandals, put them on his head, and left; he studied the
living word, not the dead word-each day renewed, each mo­
ment renewed; even the thousand sages could not stir a
hairsbreadth. You must bring forth your own family treasure;
only then will you see the great function of his total capacity.
He is saying, "I am King of Dharma, free in all respects."a

361

362

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Many people misunderstand and say that Chao Chou tem­
porarily made his sandals into the cat. Some say he meant,
"When you say, 'If you can speak, then I won't kill it,' I would
then put my sandals on my head and leave. It's just you killing
the cat-it is none of my business." But this has nothing to do
with iti this is just giving play to the spirit. You are far from
knowing that the Ancient's meaning was like the universal
cover of the sky, like the universal support of the earth.
That father and son conformed with each otheri the edges of
their activity met with each other. When Nan Ch'uan raised
the head, Chao Chou immediately understood the tail. Stu­
dents these days do not know the turning point of the An­
cients, and vainly go to the road of ideation to figure them out.
If you want to see, just go to Nan Ch'uan's and Chao Chou's
turning points and you will see them well.

VERSE

The public case completed, he questions Chao Chou:
The words are still in our ears. No use to cut any more. He
hangs a medicine bag on the back of a hearse.
In the city of Ch'ang An, he's free to wander at leisure. b
He has attained such joyfullivelinessi he has attained
such freedom. He lets his hands pick the plants. I cannot
but let you go on this way.
His straw sandals he wears on his head-no one understands;
Yet there is one or a half. This is a special style. Light is
fitting, darkness is also fitting.
Returning to his native village, then he rests.
You should be given thirty blows right where you stand.
But tell me, where is the fault? It's just that you are rais­
ing waves where there is no wind. They let each other off.
I only fear you will not be thusi if so, it's quite unusual.

COMMENTARY

"The public case completed, he questions Chao Chou." The
librarian Ch'ing said, "It is like a man settling a casei eight
strokes of the staff is eight strokesi thirteen is thirteen. Already

Sixty-fourth Case

363

he has settled it completely. Yet he then brings it up to ask
Chao Chou."
Chao Chou was a man of his household and understood the
essence of Nan Ch'uan's meaning. He was a man who had
thoroughly passed through;

struck,

he resounds and im­

mediately rolls. He possesses the eyes and brain of a genuine
adept; as soon as he hears it mentioned, he immediately gets
up and acts.
Hsueh Tou says, "In the city of Ch'ang An, he is free to roam
at leisure." He is quite a dotard. An Ancient said, "Although
Ch'ang An is pleasant, it is not a place to stay for long." It has
also been said, "Ch'ang An is quite noisy; my province is
peaceful." Still, you must recognize what is appropriate to the
situation and distinguish good and bad before you will under­
stand.
"His grass sandals he wears on his head-no one under­
stands." When he put the sandals on his head, this bit, though
without so much ado, is why it is said, "Only I myself can
know, only I myself can experience it." Then you will be able
to see how Nan Ch'uan, Chao Chou, and Hsueh Tou attained
alike and acted alike.
But tell me, right now, how will you understand? "Return­
ing to his native village, then he rests." What place is his native
village? If he didn't understand, he surely wouldn't speak this
way. Since he did understand, tell me, where is the native
village. I strike immediately.

TRANSLATORS

'

NOTES

This phrase is taken from the Saddharmapundarika scripture,
where it refers to the Buddha's independent mastery in the use of
teachings, provisional or true, in a manner appropriate to the
time, situation, and capacities of the hearers.

b.

Commentaries explain variously that this second line refers to
Nan Ch'uan, to Chao Chou, or to both. Ch'ang An, which name
means "eternal peace," was at various times a capital of the
Chinese empire. As "the capital," it was used in Ch'an to refer to
enlightenment; that one should not dwell forever in Ch'ang An is
a re-statement of the admonition to transcend all sense of attain­
ment, not to be attached to the Dharma.

SIXTY-FIFTH CASE

An Outsider Questions the Buddha

POINTER

Appearing without form, filling the ten directions of space,
expanding everywhere equally; responding without mind, ex­
tending over lands and seas without trouble; understanding
three when one is raised, judging grains and ounces at the
glance of an eye. Even if the blows of your staff fall like rain and
your shouts are like thunder rolling, still you have not yet
filled the footsteps of a trancendent man. But tell me, what is
the business of a transcendent man? Try to see.

CASE

An outsider asked the Buddha, "I do not ask about the spoken
or the unspoken."1 The World Honored One remained silent.2
The outsider sighed in admiration and said, "The World Hon­
ored One's great kindness and great compassion have opened
up my clouds of illusion and let me gain entry."3
After the outsider had left, Ananda asked the Buddha, "What
did the outsider realize, that he said he had gained entry?"4 The
Buddha said, "Like a good horse, he goes as soon as he sees the
shadow of the whip."5

NOTES

1.

Although he is not a member of the household, still he has a bit of
a fragrant air. Twin swords fly throu gh space. It's lucky he doesn't
ask.

2.

Do not slander the World Honored One; his voice is like thunder.
No one sitting or standing here could move him.

3.

A sharp fellow-one push and he rolls, a brigh t pearl in a bowl.

know. He is trying to repair a pot with cold iron.

Tell me, what do you call the shadow of the whip? Striking with
my whisk, (I say) on the staff there is an eye bright as the sun. If
you want to know if it is real gold, see it through fire. Having
gotten a mouth, eat.

COMMENTARY

If this matter were in words and phrases, do not the twelve
parts of the Teachings of the Three Vehicles contain words and
phrases? Some say it is right just not to speak. Then what
would have been the use of the Patriarch's coming from the
West? As for so many public cases which have come down
from ancient times, after all how will you see what they are
getting at?
This one public case is understood verbally by quite a few
people. Some call it remaining silent, some call it remaining
seated, and some call it silently not answering. But fortunately
none of this has anything to do with it; how could you ever
manage to find it by groping around? This matter really isn't in
words and phrases, yet it is not apart from words and phrases. If
you have the slightest bit of hesitation, then you are a
thousand miles, ten thousand miles away. See how after that
outsider had intuitively awakened, only then did he realize
that it is neither here nor there, neither in affirmation nor in
negation. But tell me, what is this?
Master I Huai of T'ien I made a verse which said,
Vimalakirti was not silent, did not remain that
way;a
Sitting on his seat engaged in deliberation, he made
an error.
Though the sharp sword is in its scabbard, its chill
light is cold;
Outsiders and celestial demons all fold their hands
helplessly.
When Master Tao Ch'ang of Pai Chang was studying with Fa
Yen, Yen had him contemplate this story. Fa Yen one day
asked him, "What incident are you contemplating?" Ch'ang
said, "The outsider questioning the Buddha." Yen said, "Stop!
Stop! You're about to go to his silence to understand, aren't

you? " At these words Ch'ang was suddenly greatly enlight­
ened. Later, in teaching his community, he said, "On Pai
Chang there are three secrets; 'drink tea,' 'take care,' and
'rest.' If you still try to think any more about them, I know you
are still not through."
"Breast-beater Chen" of Ts'ui Yen cited (this case) and said,
"In the six directions and nine states, blue, yellow, red, and
white each intermingle."
The outsider knew the four Vedas and told himself he was
omniscient; everywhere he was, he drew people into discus­
sions. He posed a question, hoping to cut off old Shakya Budd­
ha's tongue. The World Honored One did not expend any
energy, yet the outsider was immediately awakened. He sighed
in admiration and said, "The World Honored One's great kind­
ness and great compassion have opened up the clouds of my
confusion and allowed me to gain entry."
But tell me, where are the World Honored One's great kind­
ness and compassion? The World Honored One's single eye
sees through past, present, and future; the outsider's twin
pupils penetrate the Indian continent.
Chen Ju of Kuei Shan brought this up and said,
The heretic had the most precious jewel hidden
within;
The World Honored One kindly lifted it on high for
him.
Forests of patterns are clearly revealed,
Myriad forms are evident.

But after all, what did the outsider realize? It was like chasing a
dog towards a fence: when he gets as far as is possible, when
there is no way to get by, he must turn around and come back;
then he will be leaping lively. If you cast away judgement and
comparison and affirmation and negation all at once, your
emotions ended and your views gone, it will naturally become
thoroughly obvious.
After the outsider had left, Ananda asked the Buddha, "What
did the outsider realize, that he said he had gained entry?" The
Buddha said, "Like a good horse, he goes as soon as he sees the
shadow of the whip." Since then, everywhere it has been said
that at this point even he was blown by the wind into a differ­
ent tune. It has also been said that he had a dragon's head but a

Sixty-fifth Case

snake's tail. Where is the shadow of the World Honored One's
whip? Where is the seeing of the shadow of the whip? Hsueh
Tau said, "False and true are not separate; the fault comes from
the shadow of the whip."
Chen Ju said, "Ananda's golden bell is rung twice, and
everyone hears it together. Even though this is so, it is very
much like two dragons fighting for a jewel. It matured the
majestic dragon of that other wise one."

VERSE

The wheel of potential has never turned;

It is here. After all it doesn't move a bit.
If it turns, it will surely go two ways.

If it doesn't fall into existence, it will surely fall into
nonexistence; if it doesn't go east, then it will go west.
The left eye is half a pound, the right eye eight ounces.
A clear mirror is suddenly leaned on a stand,
But do you see old Shakyamuni? One push and it turns.

Broken! Broken! Scattered! Scattered!
And immediately distinguishes beautiful and ugly.
The whole world is the gate of liberation. I should give

you thirty blows of the staff. But do you see old
Shakyamuni?
Beautiful and ugly distinct, the clouds of illusion open.

He lets out a pathway. I allow as you have a place to tum
your body, but nevertheless you're just an outsider.
In the gate of compassion, where is any dust produced�

The whole world has never concealed it. Retreat;
retreat-Bodhidharma has come.
Thus I think of a good horse seeing the whip's shadow:
I have a staff; there's no need for you to give me one. But

tell me, where is the shadow of the whip, and where is the
good horse?
Gone a thousand miles in pursuit of the wind, I call him back;

Riding on the Buddha-hall, I go out the main gate. If he
turns around, he goes wrong. He shouldn't be let go, so I
strike.

Calling, if I get him to return, I'd snap my fingers thrice.
He neither reaches the village nor gets to the shop. With
your staff broken, where will you go? The sound of Hsueh
Tou's thunder is great, but there is no rain at all.

COMMENTARY

"The wheel of potential has never turned; if it turns it will
surely go two ways." The "potential" is the spiritual potential
of the thousand sages; the "wheel" is the original lifeline of all
people. Have you not read Hsueh Tou's saying,
The spiritual potential of the thousand sages is not
easily approached;
Dragon's sons born of dragons, do not be irresolute.
Chao Chou has stolen a gem worth many cities;
The King of Ch'in and Hsiang fu both lose their
lives. b
The outsider, after all, was able to hold it still and be the
master; he never moved at all. How so? He said, "I do not ask
about the spoken or the unspoken." Is this not the entirety of
potential?
The World Honored One knew how to observe the wind to
set the sail, how to give medicine in accordance with the dis­
ease; that is why he remained silent. The entire potential up­
lifted, the outsider merged with it completely; his wheel of
potential then turned freely and smoothly: it neither turned
towards existence nor nonexistence; it did not fall into gain or
loss, was not bound by the ordinary or the holy-both sides
were cut off at once. Just as the World Honored One remained
silent, the other bowed. Many people nowadays fall into
nonexistence, or else they fall into existence; they only remain
within being and non-being, running either way.
Hsueh Tou says, "A clear mirror is suddenly leaned on a
stand, and immediately distinguishes beautiful and ugly." This
has never moved; it just calls for silence, like a clear mirror
leaning on its stand-myriad forms cannot avoid their appear­
ance.
The outsider said, "The World Honored One's great kind­
ness and compassion have opened my clouds of illusion and

Sixty-fifth Case

369

allowed me to gain entry." Tell me, where is the outsider's
point of entry? At this point, you must each seek on your own,
investigate on your own, awaken on your own, and understand
on your own before you will find it. Then in all places, walking,
standing, sitting, and lying, without question of high or low, all
at once it is completely manifest and does not move at all
anymore. The moment they make judgements and compari­
sons, or have the slightest hair of rationalization, then this
blocks people up completely, and there is no more ability to
enter actively.
The last part versifies, "The World Honored One's great
kindness and great compassion have opened up the clouds of
my illusion and allowed me to gain entry." Right away he
abruptly distinguishes beautiful and ugly; "Beautiful and ugly
distinct, the clouds of illusion open; in the gate of compassion,
where is any dust produced?" The whole world is the door of
the World Honored One's great compassion. If you can pass
through, it's not worth grasping. This also is an open door.
Have you not read how the World Honored One contemplated
this matter for twenty-one days-"1 would rather not explain
the truth, but quickly enter extinction."
"So I think of a good horse seeing the shadow of the whip;
gone a thousand miles in pursuit of the wind, I call him back."
A "wind-chasing" horse, seeing the shadow of a whip, im­
mediately goes a thousand miles; if you make it return, it re­
turns. Hsueh Tau intends to praise him by saying, "If you find
an excellent breed, then you can give one push, and he im­
mediately rolls; one call, and he immediately comes back.
Calling, if I get him to return, I'd snap my fingers thrice." But
tell me, is this criticism, or is it scattering sand?

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Hsiang Ju was a minister of the King of Chao in the early third
century B.C., during the "Warring States" period; he was sent to
offer a rare gem to the king of Ch'in (a neighboring state in what is
now northern China) in exchange for dominion over fifteen cities.
After presenting the gem, Hsiang Ju perceived that the king of
Ch'in was reluctant to keep his part of the bargain; so he used a
ruse to get the gem back, and had it returned secretly to the
kingdom of Chao. In this poem from his Tsu

Ying Chi ("Collec­

tion on Outstanding Ancestors"), Hsueh Tou constructs a simile
based on the name of Chao Chou, the place where the great Ch'an
master Ts'ung Shen

(778-897) lived. He was called by the name of

the place, which had been in the ancient Kingdom of Chao. The
King of Ch'in and Hsiang Ju represent opposition; the Buddha,
represented by Ch'an master Chao Chou, cuts off opposition by
taking away the object of contention.

SIXTY-SIXTH CASE

Yen T'ou's Getting Huang Ch'ao's

Sword

POINTER

Meeting the situation head-on, setting a pitfall for a tiger; at­
tacking from front and side, laying out strategy to capture a
thief. Adapting in light and adapting in darkness, letting both
go or gathering both in, knowing how to play with a deadly
snake-all this is a matter for an adept.

CASE

Yen T'ou asked a monk, "Where do you come from?"1
The monk said, "From the Western Capital."2
Yen T'ou said, "After Huang Ch'ao had gone, did you get his
sword?"3
The monk said, "I got it."4
Yen T'ou extended his neck, came near and said, "Yaa!"5
The monk said, "Your head has fallen, Master."6 Yen T'ou
laughed out loud. 7
Later that monk went to Hsueh Feng. 8 Feng asked, "Where
did you come from?"9 The monk said, "From Yen T'ou."10
Hsueh Feng said, "What did he have to say?"11 The monk re­
counted the preceding story.12 Hsueh Feng hit him thirty blows
with his staff and drove him out.l3

NOTES

1. He is defeated before he even opens his mouth. (Yen T'ou) is

boring into a skullbone. If you want to know where he's coming
from, it's not hard.
2. After all, he's a petty thief.
3. Yen T'ou has never been a petty thief. He doesn't fear losing his

head, so he asks such a question: he's very courageous indeed!

371

372

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

4. He's defeated, but doesn't know where to turn. Ignoramuses are

as plentiful as hemp and millet.
5. He must know what's appropriate to the moment, to do this. This

is a pitfall to catch a tiger. What is going on in his mind?
6. He only sees the sharpness of the awl; he does not see the square­

ness of the chisel. What good or bad does he know? He's struck!
7. No patchrobed monk in the world can do anything to him. He

completely fools everyone in the world. No one can find out
where this old fellow's head has fallen.
8. As before, he is fatheaded and stupid. This monk is thoroughly

defeated time and again.
9. He cannot but tell where he comes from; but still Hsueh Feng

wants to try him.
10. After all he is defeated.
11. If he can recite it, he won't avoid getting hit.
12. Right then he should be driven out.
13. Although it is true that he cuts nails and shears through iron, why

does he only strike thirty blows with his staff? He hasn't yet
gotten to the point where his staff breaks. This is not yet the real
thing. Why?

"Three thousand blows in the morning, eight

hundred blows in the evening." If (Hsueh Feng) were not a fellow
student (with Yen T'ou), how could he discern the point? Al­
though this is so, just tell me, where do Hsueh Feng and Yen T'ou
abide?

COMMENTARY

Whenever you carry your bag and bowl, pulling out the weeds
seeking the Way, you must first possess the foot-travelling eye.
This monk's eyes were like comets, yet he was still thoroughly
exposed by Yen T'ou, and pierced all the way through on a
single string. At that time, if he had been a man, whether it
were to kill or to enliven, he would have made use of it im­
mediately as soon as it was brought up. But this monk was a
rickety dotard and instead said, "I got it." If you travel on foot
like this, the King of Death will question you and demand you
pay your grocery bill. I don't know how many straw sandals he
wore out until he got to Hsueh Feng. At that time, if he had had
a little bit of eye power, then he would have been able to get a
glimpse; wouldn't that have felt good?

Sixty-sixth Case

This story has a knotty complication in it. Although this
matter has neither gain nor loss, the gain and loss are tremen­
dous: although there is no picking and choosing, when you get
here, you after all must possess the eyes to pick and choose.
See how when Lung Ya was travelling on foot, he posed this
question to Te Shan: "How is it when the student wants to
take the Master's head with a sharp sword?" Te Shan stretched
out his neck, approached, and said, "Yaa!" Lung Ya said, "The
Master's head has fallen." Te Shan returned to the abbot's
room. Lung Ya later recited this to Tung Shan. Tung Shan said,
"What did Te Shan say at the time?" Lung Ya said, "He said
nothing." Tung Shan said, "His having nothing to say, I leave
aside for the moment: just bring Te Shan's fallen head for me to
see." Lung Ya at these words was greatly awakened; later he
burned incense, and gazing far off towards Te Shan, he bowed
and repented. A monk repeated this to Te Shan. Te Shan said,
"Old man Tung Shan does not know good from bad; this fellow
has been dead for so long, even if you could revive him, what
would be the use?"
This public case is the same as that of Lung Ya: Te Shan
returned to the abbot's room; thus in darkness he was most
wonderful. Yen T'ou laughs loudly-in his laugh there is
poison: if any one could discern it, he could travel freely
throughout the world. If this monk had been able to pick it out
at that moment, he would have escaped critical examination
for all time. But at Yen T'ou's place, he had already missed it.
Observe that old man Hsueh Feng; being a fellow student (with
Yen T'ou), he immediately knew where he was at. Still, he
didn't explain it all for that monk, but just hit him thirty blows
of the staff and drove him out of the monastery. Thereby he
was "before light and after annihilation." This is the method of
holding up the nostrils of an adept patchrobed monk to help
the person; he doesn't do anything else for him, but makes him
awaken on his own.
When genuine teachers of our school help people, some­
times they trap them and do not let them come out; sometimes
they release them and let them be slovenly. After all, they
must have a place to appear. Yen T'ou and Hsueh Feng, sup­
posedly so great, were on the contrary exposed by this rice­
eating Ch'an follower. When Yen T'ou said, 11After Huang
Ch'ao had gone, did you get his sword?" People, tell me, what

374

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

could be said here to avoid his laughter, and to avoid Hsueh
Feng's brandishing his staff and driving him out? Here it is
difficult to understandi if you have never personally witnessed
and personally awakened, even if your mouth is swift and
sharp to the very end, you will not be able to pass through and
out of birth and death. I always teach people to observe the
pivot of this actioni if you hesitate, you are far, far away from
it. Have you not seen how T'ou Tzu asked a monk from Yen
Ping, "Have you brought a sword?" The monk pointed at the
ground with his hand. T'ou Tzu said, "For thirty years I have
been handling horses, but today I have been kicked by a mule."
Look at that monki he too was undeniably an adept-neither
did he say he had it, nor did he say he did not have iti he was
like an ocean away from the monk from the Western Capital.
Chen Ju brought this up and said, "Those Ancientsi one acted
as the head, the other as the tail, for sure."
Hsueh Tau's verse says,

VERSE

After Huang Ch'ao's passing, he had picked up the sword.
What is the usefulness of an impetous fellow? This is just
a tin knife.
The great laughter after all needs an adept to understand it.
One son is familiar with it. How many could be?
Thirty blows of the mountain cane is still a light punishment;
Born of the same lineage, they die of the same lineage. In
the morning, three thousandi in the evening, eight
hundred. When someone in the eastern house dies, some­
one of the western house helps in the mourning. But can
they bring him back to life?
To take advantage is to lose the advantage.
He settles the case according to the facts. It is regrettable
not to have been careful in the very beginning.

COMMENTARY

"After Huang Ch'ao's passing, he had picked up the sword. The
great laughter needs an adept to understand it." Hsueh Tou

Sixty-sixth Case

375

immediately versifies this monk and Yen T'ou's great laughter.
This little bit cannot be grasped by anyone in the world. But
tell me, what was he laughing at? You must be an adept in
order to know. In this laughter there is the provisional, there is
the real; there is illumination and there is function; there is
killing and there is giving life.
"Thirty blows of the mountain cane is still a light punish­
ment." This versifies this monk later coming into the presence
of Hsueh Feng: the monk was as crude as before, so Feng there­
upon acted as was imperative, and hit him thirty times with
his staff and drove him out. But tell me, why did he act like
this? Do you want to understand this story fully? "To take the
advantage is to lose the advantage."

TRANSLATORS' NOTES

a.

In 874 a rebellion against the T'ang dynasty broke out, and under
the leadership of Wang Hsien-chih overthrew government forces
in many parts of China. Huang Ch'ao was a follower of Wang, and
when the latter was killed in the fifth year of the rebellion, Huang
Ch'ao took over the leadership of the rebel forces. Eventually they
occupied Ch'ang An, the western capital, and slew all the mem­
bers of the Imperial family who were still there. Huang Ch'ao
proclaimed himself Emperor and intended to start a new dynasty,
but in 881 he was finally driven out of Ch'ang An, and in 884 he
was at last defeated and killed. This great rebellion, which
brought about the ultimate downfall of the T'ang dynasty, is usu­
ally known as the Huang Ch'ao rebellion. Huang Ch'ao himself
had earlier failed the government civil service examinations sev­
eral times and had taken up salt-selling. According to legend, one
day he suddenly obtained a sword which was inscribed, "Heaven
gives this to Huang Ch'ao," and this inspired him to join the rebel
forces of Wang Hsien-chih. In Ch'an terminology, a sword is a
metaphor for pra;na, or transcendent wisdom; Yen T'ou used the
fact that the monk came from Ch'ang An to pose his question in
this way. Yen T'ou died in 887, so the Huang Ch'ao rebellion was
a current event.

Sixty-seventh Case

3 77

COMMENTARY

Emperor Wu, the founder of the Liang Dynasty, was of the
Hsiao clan. His name was Yen and his nickname was Shu Ta.
By the deeds he accomplished, he came to secure the abdica­
tion of the Ch'i Dynasty. a After he had assumed the throne, he
made new commentaries on the Five Confucian Classics, to
expound them. He served Huang-Lao (Taoism) very faithfully,
and his nature was most filial.
One day he thought of attaining the transmundane teaching
in order to requite (his parents') toil. At this point he aban­
doned Taoism and served Buddhism. Then he received the
Bodhisattva precepts from the Dharma Master Lou Yueh. He
put on Buddhist vestments and personally expounded the
Light-emitting Wisdom Scripture to recompense his parents.
At the time, the Mahasattva Master Chih, because he man­
ifested wonders and confused people, was confined in prison.
Master Chih then reproduced his body and wandered around
teaching in the city. The emperor one day found out about this
and was inspired. He esteemed Chih most highly. Master Chih
time and again practiced protective concealment; his disap­
pearances and appearances were incomprehensible.
At that time there was a Mahasattva in Wu Chou, dwelling
on Yun Huang Mountain. He had personally planted two trees
and called them the "Twin Trees." He called himself the "Fu­
ture Mahasattva Shan Hui." One day he composed a letter and
had a disciple present it to the emperor. At the time, the court
did not accept it because he had neglected the formalities of a
subject in respect to the ruler.
When the Mahasattva Fu was going to go into the city of
Chin Ling (Nanking, the capital of Liang) to sell fish, at that
time the emperor Wu happened to request Master Chih to ex­
pound the Diamond Cutter Scripture. Chih said, "This poor
wayfarer cannot expound it, but in the market place there is a
Mahasattva Fu who is able to expound the scripture." The
emperor issued an imperial order to summon him to the inner
palace.
Once Mahasattva Fu had arrived, he mounted the lecturing
seat, shook the desk once, and then got down off the seat. At
that moment, if (Wu) had pushed it over for him, he would

378

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

have avoided a mess; instead he was asked by Master Chih,
"Does Your Majesty understand?" The emperor said, "I do not
understand." Master Chih said, "The Mahasattva has ex­
pounded the scripture thoroughly." This too is one man acting
as the head and one man acting as the tail. But when Master
Chih spoke in this way, did he after all see Mahasattva Fu, even
in a dream? Everyone gives play to their spirits, but this one is
outstanding among them. Although it is a deadly snake, if you
know how to handle it, you'll still be alive. Since he was ex­
pounding the scripture, why then did he not make the general
distinction into two aspects, just as ordinary lecturers say­
"The substance of the Diamond is hard and solid, so that noth­
ing can destroy it; because of its sharp function, it can smash
myriad things." Explaining like this could then be called ex­
pounding the scripture. People hardly understand: the
Mahasattva Fu only brought up the transcendental mainspring
and briefly showed the swordpoint, to let people know the
ultimate intent, directly standing it up for you like a mile-high
wall. It was only appropriate that he should be subject to Mas­
ter Chih's ignorance of good and bad in saying, "The
Mahasattva has expounded the scripture thoroughly." Indeed,
he had a good intent but didn't get a good response. It was like a
cup of fine wine, which was diluted with water by Master
Chih; like a bowl of soup being polluted by Master Chih with a
piece of rat shit.
But tell me, granted that this is not expounding the scrip­
ture, ultimately what can you call it? The verse says,

VERSE

He does not rest this body by the Twin Trees:
It's just because he can't hold still. How could it be possi­
ble to hide a sharp awl inside a bag?
Instead, in the land of Liang he stirs up dust.
If he did not enter the weeds, how could we see the point?
Where there is no style, there is still style.
At that time, if it weren't for old Master Chih,
To be a thief, one does not need capital. There is a leper
dragging a companion along.

Sixty-seventh Case

3 79

He too would have been a man hastily leaving the country.
His crime should be listed on the same indictment; so I

strike.

COMMENTARY

"He does not rest this body by the Twin Trees; instead, in the
land of Liang he stirs up dust." Mahasattva Fu and that old
gap-toothed fellow (Bodhidharma) met (Emperor Wu) in the
same way. When Bodhidharma first arrived at Chin Ling and
saw Emperor Wu, the emperor asked, "What is the highest
meaning of the holy truths?" Bodhidharma said, "Empty,
without holiness." The emperor said, "Who is here in my pres­
ence?" Bodhidharma said,"I don't know." The emperor did not
understand, so Bodhidharma eventually crossed the river into
Wei. Emperor Wu mentioned this to Master Chih and asked
him about it. Chih said, "Does Your Majesty recognize this
man, or not?" The emperor said, "I do not recognize him."
Master Chih said, "This is the Mahasattva Avalokitesvara,
transmitting the seal of the Buddha-mind." The emperor felt
regret and so sent an emissary to get (Bodhidharma). Master
Chih said, "Don't tell me Your Majesty is going to send an
emissary to get him: even if everyone in the country went, he
would not return." That is why Hsueh Tou says,"At that time,
if not for Master Chih, he too would have been a man hastily
leaving the country." At the time, if it hadn't been for Master
Chih exerting energy on behalf of Mahasattva Fu, he too would
surely have been driven out of the country. Since Master Chih
was so talkative, Emperor Wu after all was fooled by him.
Hsueh Tou's intent is to say that there is no need for him to
come to the land of Liang to expound the scripture and shake
the desk. That's why he says, "Why does he not rest this body
by the Twin Trees, eating gruel and eating rice, passing the
time according to his means? Instead he comes to the land of
Liang, and comments in this way-shaking the desk once, he
immediately gets down off the seat." This is where he stirs up
dust.
If you want the marvelous, then look at the cloudy skies;
above you do not see that there is any Buddha, and below you
do not see that there are any sentient beings. If you discuss the

380

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

business of appearing in the world, you cannot avoid ashes on
your head and dirt on your face, taking the non-existent and
making it exist, taking the existent and making it not exist;
taking right and making it wrong, taking coarse and making it
fine; in the fish markets and wineshops, holding it sideways
and using it upside down, making everyone understand this
matter. If you do not let go in this way, then even until Mait­
reya is born, there will not be one or a half (who will under­
stand). Mahasattva Fu was already dragging in mud and drip­
ping with water; fortunately he had a sympathizer. If not for
old Master Chih, he would probably have been driven out of
the country. But tell me, where is he now?

crowd: he had great capacity and had great function; while still
in the community, he was in full vigor, and his name was
known everywhere.
Later he left Lin Chi and travelled throughout Huai Nan and
Hai Choua; the monasteries everywhere he went all treated
him as a distinguished guest. He went from the north to the
south; first he went to Hsueh Feng and asked, "What does a
golden carp who has passed through the net take for food?"
Feng said, "Wait till you've come out of the net; then I'll tell
you." Sheng said, "The teacher of fifteen hundred people
doesn't even know what to say." Feng said, "My tasks as abbot
are many." As Hsueh Feng was going to the temple manor, on
the way he encountered some macaques, whereupon he said,
"Each of the macaques is wearing an ancient mirror." San
Sheng said, "For aeons it has been nameless; why do you depict
it as an ancient mirror?" Feng said, "A flaw has been created."
Sheng said, "The teacher of fifteen hundred people does not
even know what to say." Feng said, "My fault. My tasks as
abbot are many."
Later he came to Yang Shan. Shan very much admired his
outstanding acuity and seated him under the bright window.b
One day an official came to call on Yang Shan. Shan asked him.
"What is your official position?" He said, "I am a judge." Shan
raised his whisk and said, "And can you judge this?" The offi­
cial was speechless. All the people of the community made
comments, but none accorded with Yang Shan's idea. At that
time San Sheng was sick and staying in the Life-Prolonging
Hall: Yang Shan ordered his attendant to take these words and
ask him about them. Sheng said, "The Master has a problem."
(Yang Shan) again ordered his attendant to ask, "What is the
problem?" Sheng said, "A second offense is not permitted."
Yang Shan deeply approved of this.
Pai Chang had formerly imparted his meditation brace and
cushion to Huang Po, and had bequeathed his staff and whisk
to Kuei Shan; Kuei Shan later gave them to Yang Shan. Since
Yang Shan greatly approved of San Sheng, when one day Sheng
took his leave and departed, Yang Shan took his staff and whisk
to hand them over to San Sheng. Sheng said, "I already have a
teacher." When Yang Shan inquired into his reason for saying
this, it was that he was a true heir of Lin Chi.
When Yang Shan asked San Sheng, "What is your name?"

Sixty-eighth Case

383

he could not have but known his name; why did he then go
ahead and ask in this way? The reason is that an adept wants to
test people to be able to know them thoroughly. He just
seemed to be casually asking, "What is your name?", and spoke
no further judgement or comparison. Why did San Sheng not
say "Hui Jan," but instead said, "Hui Chi"? See how a man
who has the eye is naturally not the same (as others). This
manner of San Sheng's was still not crazy, though; he simply
captured the flag and stole the drum. His meaning was beyond
Yang Shan's words. These words do not fall within the scope of
ordinary feelings; they are difficult to get a grasp on. The
methods of such a fellow can bring people to life; that is why it
is said, "He studies the living phrase-he does not study the
dead phrase." If they followed ordinary feelings, then they
couldn't set people at rest.
See how those men of old contemplated the Path like this:
they exerted their spirits to the utmost, and only then were
capable of great enlightenment. Once they were completely
enlightened, when they used it, after all they appeared the
same as people who were not yet enlightened. In any case, their
one word or half a phrase could not fall into ordinary feelings.
San Sheng knew where Yang Shan was at, so he said to him,
"My name is Hui Chi." Yang Shan wanted to take in San
Sheng, but San Sheng conversely took in Yang Shan. Yang Shan
was only able to make a counterattack and say, "I am Hui
Chi." This is where he let go. San Sheng said. "My name is Hui
Jan." This too is letting go. This is why Hsueh Tou later says,
"Both gather in, both let go-which is fundamental?" With
just one phrase he has completely versified it all at once.
Yang Shan laughed aloud. "Ha,ha!" There was both the pro­
visional and the real, there was both illumination and func­
tion. Because he was crystal clear in every respect, therefore he
functioned with complete freedom. This laugh was not the
same as Yen T'ou's; in Yen T'ou's laugh there was poison, but
in this laugh, for all eternity the pure wind blows chill.

VERSE

Both gather in, both let go-which is fundamental?
I don't know how many of them there are. Crystal clear in

every respect. I thought that there really was such a thing.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

To ride a tiger always requires absolute competence.
If you don't have the eye on your forehead and a talisman

under your elbow, how could you get here? Ride you may,
but I only fear you won't be able to get down. If you are
not such a man, how could you understand such a thing?
His laughter ended, I do not know where he's gone;

Even if you seek throughout the country for such a man,
he would be hard to find. His words are still in our ears.
For ever and ever there is the pure wind.
It is only fitting eternally to stir the wind of lament.

Right now where is he? Bah! Since it is great laughter,
why (does it) stir a piteous wind? The whole earth is
flooded with darkness.

COMMENTARY

"Both gather in, both let go-which is fundamental?" Letting
go, alternately they act as guest and host. Yang Shan says,
"What is your name?" San Sheng says, "My name is Hui Chi."
This is both letting go. Yang Shan says, "I am Hui Chi." Sheng
says, "I am Hui Jan." This is both gathering in. In reality, this is
the action of interchange: when gathering up, everyone gathers
up; when letting go, everyone lets go. Hsueh T'ou has all at
once completely versified it. What he means to say is that if we
don't let go and gather up, if we don't interchange, then you are
you and I am I.
The whole thing is just four characters (Hui Chi, Hui Jan):
why is there after all emergence and disappearance, spreading
out and rolling up therein? An Ancient said, "If you stand, I
then sit; if you sit, I then stand. If we both sit or both stand at
the same time, we'll both be blind men." This is both gather­
ing, both releasing, which can be considered the fundamental
essential.
"To ride a tiger always requires absolute competence."
When you have such a lofty manner, the highest essential of
active potential, when you want to ride, you ride; when you
want to dismount, you dismount. You can sit on the tiger's
head and also hold the tiger's tail. San Sheng and Yang Shan
both had this style.

"His laughter ended, I do not know where he's gone." Tell
me, what did he laugh at? He was just like the pure wind
blowing chill and severe. Why does (Hsueh Tou) after all say in
the end, "It is only fitting eternally to stir the wind of lament"?
This too is death without mourning; all at once he has finished
adding explanations for you, but nevertheless no one in the
world can bite in, and they do not know where (Yang Shan) is
at. Even I do not know where he is at; do you people know?

COMMENTARY

At that time Ma Tsu's teaching was flourishing in Kiangsi,
Shih T'ou's Way was current in Hu-Hsiang (Hunan), and Na­
tional Teacher Chung's Way was influencing Ch'ang An. The
latter had personally seen the Sixth Patriarch; at the time, of
those in the South who held up their heads and wore horns,
there was none who did not want to ascend his hall and enter
his room; otherwise, they would be shamed by others.
These three old fellows wanted to go pay respects to Na­
tional Teacher Chung; when they got half-way, they enacted
this scenario of defeat. Nan Ch'uan said, "Then let's not go."
Since they had each been able to speak, why did he instead say
he wouldn't go? Tell me, what was the intention of that man of
old? At that time, when he said, "Then let's not go," I would
have slapped him right on the ear, to see what trick he would
pull; what eternally upholds the all-embracing source is just
this little bit of active essence. That is why Tz'u Ming said, "If
you want to restrain him, just grab the rein and yank." Hit and
he turns, like pushing down a gourd on the water. Many people
say that (Nan Ch'uan's) words are words of disagreement, but
they are far from knowing that in this matter, when you get to
the ultimate point, it is necessary to leave the mud, get out of
the water, draw out the wedges, and pull out the nails. If you
make an intellectual interpretation, then you've missed it. The
Ancients could tum and shift well; at this point they could not
be otherwise-there must be killing and giving life: see how
one of them sat inside the circle, and one curtseyed. That too
was very good. Nan Ch'uan said, "Then let's not go." Kuei
Tsung said, "What is going on in your mind?" Brash fellow! He
too goes on like this. His whole idea was that he wanted to test
Nan Ch'uan. Nan Ch'uan always said, "Call it thusness, and
already it has changed." Nan Ch'uan, Kuei Tsung, and Ma
Ku-after all they were people of one house. One holds, one
releases; one kills, one enlivens: undeniably they are excep­
tional.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
VERSE

You Chi's arrow shoots the monkey:
Who would dare to advance on the road facing
him?Whenever he hits, he is marvelous; he hits the mark
before he shoots.
Circling the tree, how exceedingly direct!
Without attaining mastery, how could one presume to be
thus? North, south, east, west-one family style. They
have already been going around for a long time.
A thousand and ten thousand-

Plentiful as hemp and millet. A pack of wild fox spirits.
What about Nan Ch'uan?
Who has ever hit the markt
One or a half. Not even one. Even one would still be no

Calling them together, he beckons them, "Come, let's go
back;"
They're a bunch of fellows playing with a lump of mud.
This is not as good as having gone back; then they would
have gotten somewhere.
He stops climbing on the road of Ts'ao Ch'i.
Too much trouble. It seems to me that he is not a member
of Ts'ao Ch'i's school. Level off the lowest of places, and
there is too much; view the highest of places, and there is
not enough .
(Hsueh Tou) also said, "The road of Ts'ao Ch'i is level and
even; why stop climbingt"
Not only Nan Ch'uan extricates himself halfway along;
Hsueh Tau also extricates himself halfway along. Even a
good thing is not as good as nothing. Hsueh Tau too suf­
fers from this kind of illness and pain.

COMMENTARY

"You Chi's arrow shoots the monkey; circling the tree, how
exceedingly direct!" You Chi was a man of Ch'u times; his
surname was Yang, his name was Shu and his nickname was

Sixty-ninth Case

389

You Chi. Once when King Chuang of Ch'u went out hunting,
he saw a white monkey and had someone shoot it. That mon­
key grabbed the arrow and played with it. The King ordered his
entourage of courtiers to shoot it, but none could hit it. The
King then asked his courtiers, and they said to him, "The man
You Chi is a good shot." So he ordered him to shoot it. As You
Chi drew his bow, the monkey immediately hugged the tree
and howled piteously. When the arrow was shot, the monkey
went around the tree to avoid it. The arrow also circled the
tree, and struck and killed the monkey. This was a super­
natural arrow. Why does Hsueh Tou say it was exceedingly
direct? If it had been too direct, it wouldn't have hit; since it
went around the tree, why instead does Hsueh Tou say it was
exceedingly direct? Hsueh Tou borrows the idea and indeed
uses it well. This even appears in the Ch'un Ch'iu:b some
people say that "circling the tree" is the circle; if they really
think so, they do not know the basic import of the words­
they do not know where the directness is. These three old
fellows are on different roads but return to the same place.
They are uniformly and equally exceedingly direct. If you
know where they're going, then you are free in all directions
without leaving your heart. A hundred rivers flow separately
but alike return to the great sea. That is why Nan Ch'uan said,
"Then let's not go." If you look at this with the true eye of a
patchrobed monk, this is just giving play to the spirit: but if
you call it giving play to the spirit, then it is not giving play to
the spirit. My late Master Wu Tsu said, "Those three men were
absorbed in the Lamp of Wisdom, absorbed in the King of
Adornment." Although (Ma Ku) curtseyed in this way, he
never understood it as curtseying; although (Nan Ch'uan)
made a circle, he never understood it as a circle. Without un­
derstanding in this way, then how will you understand? Hsueh
Tou says, "A thousand and ten thousand-who has ever hit the
mark?" How many could there be who hit the mark a hundred
times out of a hundred?
"Calling them together, he beckons them, 'Come, let us go
back."' This is versifying Nan Ch'uan's saying, "Then let's not
go on." Nan Ch'uan did not go on from here, so it is said, "He
stops climbing on the road of Ts'ao Ch'i." He destroys the
forest of thorns. Hsueh Tou cannot hold still, and again says,
"The road of Ts'ao Ch'i is level and even; why stop climbing?"

390

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

The road of Ts'ao Ch'i is dustless and trackless, openly ex­
posed, naked and clean, level, even, and smooth: why, after all,
stop climbing? Each of you should observe your own footsteps.

Kuei Shan Attends on Pai Chang

POINTER

For a fast man, a single word; for a fast horse, a single stroke of
the whip. Ten thousand years, one thought; one thought, ten
thousand years. You must know directly before it is raised.
But say, before it is raised, how will you search for it? I'm
citing this old case: look!

CASE

Kuei Shan, Wu Feng, and Yun Yen were together attending on
Pai Chang.1 Pai Chang asked Kuei Shan, "With your throat,
mouth, and lips shut, how will you speak?"2
Kuei Shan said, "Please, Teacher, you speak instead."3
Chang said, "I don't refuse to speak to you, but I fear that (if I
did) in the future I would be bereft of descendants."4

COMMENTARY

Kuei Shan, Wu Feng, and Yun Yen were together attending on
Pai Chang. Pai Chang asked Kuei Shan, "With your throat,
mouth, and lips shut, how will you speak?" Shan said, "Please,
Teacher, you speak instead." Chang said, "I don't refuse to
391

392

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

speak to you, but I fear that (if I did) in the future I would be
bereft of descendants." Although Pai Chang acted like this, his
pot had already been carried off by someone else. He also asked
Wu Feng (this same question). Feng said, "Teacher, you too
should shut up." Chang said, "Where there's no one, I shade
my eyes with my hand and gaze out towards you." He also
asked Yun Yen. Yen said, "Teacher, do you have (any way to
speak) or not?" Chang said, "I have lost my descendants." Each
of these three men was a Master.
An Ancient said, "On the level ground there are dead people
without number. Those who can pass through the forest of
brambles are the skillful ones." Therefore teachers of our
school use the forest of brambles to test people. Why? They
couldn't test people if they stuck to phrases based on ordinary
feelings. Patchrobed monks must be able to display their abil­
ity in phrases and discern the point within words. As for
board-carrying fellows, they often die within the words and
say, "If throat, mouth, and lips are shut, there's no longer a way
to say anything." As for those who can adapt successfully, they
have waves which go against the current, they have a single
road right in the question. They don't cut their hands blunder­
ing against its sharp point.
Kuei Shan said, "Please, Teacher, you speak instead." Tell
me, what did he mean? Here he was like sparks struck from
stone, like a flash of lightning: pressing back against Pai
Chang's question, he answered immediately. He had his own
way to get himself out, without wasting the slightest effort.
Thus it is said, "He studies the living phrase; he doesn't study
the dead phrase."
Nevertheless, Pai Chang did not take him up on it, but just
said, "I don't refuse to speak to you, but I fear that (if I did) in
the future I would be bereft of descendants." Whenever
teachers of our school help people, they pull out nails and
extract pegs. As for people these days who say that this answer
doesn't approve of Kuei Shan and doesn't comprehend his
words, how far they are from knowing that right here is the one
path of his living potential, towering up like a thousand­
fathom wall, interchanging guest and host, leaping with life.
Hsueh Tou likes these words of Kuei Shan's, likes his free­
dom to revolve around and maneuver elegantly while still
being able to hold fast to his territory. Therefore his verse says:

Seventieth Case

393

VERSE

"Please, Teacher, you speak instead."
This contains the universe. He's already cut his hand
against the sharp point.
The tiger's head sprouts horns as he emerges from the wild
weeds.
Very startling indeed. Undeniably, he's extraordinary.
On the ten continents spring ends and the flowers fade and
witherEverywhere is pure and cool. No praise is sufficient.
Over the coral forest the sun is dazzling bright.

(In the coral branches the light is reflected) a hundred­
fold, a thousand-fold. Nevertheless, he can't be found on
the tips of the hundred weeds. Kuei Shan's answer covers
heaven and earth.

COMMENTARY

The answers of these three men (to Pai Chang's question) are
all different from each other. There's (Kuei Shan's) towering up
like a thousand-fathom wall; there's (Wu Feng's) shining and
functioning at the same time; and there's (Yun Yen's) who
can't even save himself.
"'Please, Teacher, you speak instead. '" Immediately in this
one line Hsueh Tau has displayed his device. He goes farther
into it and presses ever so lightly to make it easy for people to
see by saying, "The tiger's head sprouts horns as he emerges
from the wild weeds." Kuei Shan's answer seems to be placing
horns on the head of a ferocious tiger-is there any way to
approach it?
Haven't you heard? A monk asked Lo Shan, "How is it when
they are born together and die together?" Shan said, "Like an
ox without horns." The monk asked, "How is it when they are
born together but don't die together?" Shan said, "Like a tiger
wearing horns."
Though Hsueh Tau has completed the verse in one couplet,
he has ample talent to turn around and change. He goes on and
says, "On the ten continents spring ends and the flowers fade

394

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

and wither." On the ocean there are ten continents where one
hundred years make one spring. Hsueh Tau's words have grace­
ful elegance, turning freely with great ease. When the spring is
over, hundreds of thousands of myriad flowers fade and wither
all at once. Only the coral tree forest doesn't fade and wither­
it takes the light of the sun and reflects it back and forth
(among the branches). At just such a time it is amazing indeed!
Hsueh Tau uses this to illuminate Kuei Shan's saying, "Please,
Teacher, you speak instead."

SEVENTY-FIRST CASE

Wu Feng's Shut Up, Teacher

CASE

Pai Chang also asked Wu Feng, "With your throat, mouth, and
lips shut, how will you speak?"1
Feng said, "Teacher, you too should shut up."2
Chang said, "Where there's no one, I shade my eyes with my
hand and gaze out towards you."3

NOTES

1.

Hahaha! The arrow has gone past Korea.

2.

He captures the banner and carries off the drum. With a single
phrase he cuts off the flow and puts to rest myriad impulses.

3.

Where the land is bro ad and the population sparse, those m et with

COMMENTARY

Kuei Shan held fast to his territory-Wu Feng cut off the
myriad streams. For this bit one must be a fellow who takes it
up directly, like a head-on clash in the front lines. There's no
room for hesitation. Wu Feng functions directly and im­
mediately: (his reply) is urgent and swift, perilous and steep.
He's not like Kuei Shan who is so relaxed and easy-going and
exuberant.
Followers of Ch'an these days just move under the shelf,
unable to go beyond him. Thus it is said, "If you want to attain
Intimacy, don't ask with questions."
Wu Feng's answer cut him off immediately; undeniably it
was fast and brilliant. Pai Chang said, "Where there's no one, I
shade my eyes with my hand and gaze out towards you." But
say, is this approving of Wu Feng or not? Is it killing or bringing
to life? Seeing him turn so smoothly, Pai Chang just was giving
him a check.
395

396

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Hsueh Tou's verse says:

VERSE

"Teacher, you too should shut up."

Already present before the words. It cuts off the myriad
streams.
Observe Wu Feng's strategy on the dragon and snake battle
lines-

It takes the golden drum and serrated banner (of a great
general) to be able to do this. He's fully equipped: he's an
expert accustomed to battle.
He makes people think of General Li Kuang.

There aren't many with such marvelous skill. With his
horse and spear (he covers) a thousand miles, ten
thousand miles, and (defeats) a thousand men, ten
thousand men.
Over the ten-thousand-mile horizon a single kingfisher hawk
soars.
Does everyone see? But say, where does it alight? On

target. I'll hit saying, "It's flown past."

COMMENTARY

"'Teacher, you too should shut up."' In one line Hsueh Tou
gives a push and says, "Observe his strategy on the dragon and
snake battle lines." It is as though Wu Feng set out two battle
lines to burst out and to burst in. He has the ability of a battle
commander, unrestrained in all directions. A man with a grand
strategy is free to appear and disappear with his horse and spear
up on the dragon and snake battle lines. How would you be
able to surround him? If you're not this kind of person, how
will you know that there is this kind of strategy?
In all these three verses (70, 71, and 72) of Hsueh Tou's,
what he describes within them is like this, like Li Kuang's
miraculous arrows.a "Over the ten-thousand-mile horizon a
single kingfisher hawk soars." That one arrow fells one eagle is
certain: there's no more (chance of) escape. In Hsueh Tou's

Seventy-first Case

397

verse, Pai Chang's question is like a kingfisher hawk- Wu
Feng's answer is like an arrow. I have been so occupied with
praising Wu Feng that without realizing it my whole body has
been immersed in mud and water.

Pai Chang Questions Yun Yen

CASE

Pai Chang also asked Yun Yen, "With your throat, mouth, and
lips shut, how will you speak?"1
Yen said, "Teacher, do you have (any way to speak) or not?"2
Chang said, "I have lost my descendants."3

Sticking to his skin, clinging to his bones. Mud and water is
streaming off him. Ahead he doesn't reach the village, behind he
doesn't get to the shop.

3.

Obviously with an answer like this, half is in front and half is left
behind.

COMMENTARY

Yun Yen was an attendant for twenty years at Pai Chang. Later
he went along with Tao Wu to Yao Shan. Shan asked him,
"When you were in Pai Chang's congregation, what was your
purpose?" Yen said, "To escape birth and death." Shan said,
"Have you escaped yet or not?" Yen said, "There's no birth and
death for this one." Shan said, "Twenty years at Pai Chang and
your force of habit still hasn't been cleared away yet." Yen took
his leave and went to see Nan Ch'uan. Later he returned to Yao
Shan and at last understood and was enlightened.
Look how the ancient man Yun Yen studied and investi­
gated for twenty years and still was half green and half yellow
(unripe). He stuck to his skin and clung to his bones, and
couldn't break through. He was indeed this way; in fact, ahead
he didn't reach the village, behind he didn't get to the shop.
Haven't you heard it said:

398

Seventy-second Case

399

If your words do not leave the old cliches,
How will you be able to get out of what covers and
binds you!
White clouds lie athwart the valley mouth,
Making so many people miss the source.

In the Ts'ao Tung tradition this is called "transgression."
Thus they say, "Throw open the well-guarded phoenix tower
but avoid transgressing (the prohibition against saying) the
present emperor's name." Hence it is said, "To attain it is first
necessary to pass beyond the forest of brambles. If you do not
pass beyond it, then from beginning to end you will get stuck
in subtleties without being able to cut them off."
As I just said, "Ahead he didn't reach his village, behind he
didn't get to his shop." Yun Yen just went to test the other
man's depths. When Pai Chang saw him acting like this, he
immediately held him and struck him dead.
Hsueh Tau's verse says:

VERSE

"Teacher, do you have (any way to speak) or not?"

The case is perfectly manifest. Yun Yen was following the
waves, pursuing the ripples, mixing with mud, mingling
with water.
The golden-haired lion is not crouching on the ground.

Obviously. What's the use? Too bad!
Two by two, three by three, travelling the old road-

"With your throat, mouth, and lips shut, how will you
speak?" Tum around and show some spirit! Though it
was right under his feet, he missed it.
On Ta Hsiung Mountain Pai Chang snapped his fingers in
vain. a
Once dead Yun Yen did not come back to life again. Too
bad! Too sad! Hsueh Tau adds more grief to his cry of
woe.

400

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

"'Teacher, do you have (any way to speak) or not?' I The
golden-haired lion is not crouching on the ground." Hsueh Tau
concludes the case on the basis of the facts. Yun Yen is indeed
one, but this golden-haired lion nevertheless is not crouching
on the ground (ready to spring). When a lion captures its prey, it

When Yun Yen said, "Teacher, do you have (any way to

SEVENTY-THIRD CASE

Ma Tsu's Permutations of Assertion

and Denial

POINTER

In explaining the Dharma, there is neither explanation nor
teaching; in listening to the Dharma, there is neither hearing
nor

attainment.

Since

explanation

neither

explains

nor

teaches, how can it compare to not explaining? Since listening
neither hears nor attains, how can it compare to not listening?
Still, no explaining and no listening still amount to something.
As for all of you right here, listening to me explain here, how
will you avoid this mistake? For those with the eye to pass
through the barrier, as a test, I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

A monk asked Grand Master Ma, "Please, Teacher, going be­
yond the permutations of assertion and denial, directly point
out to me the meaning of the coming from the West."1
Master Ma said, "I'm tired today and can't explain for you.
Go ask Chih Tsang."2
When the monk asked Chih Tsang,J Tsang said, "Why
didn't you ask the Teacher? "4 The monk said, "The Teacher
had me come here to ask you."5 Tsang said, "I have a headache
today and can't explain for you. Go ask Elder Brother Hai."6
When the monk asked Elder Brother Hai (Pai Chang ) ,7 Hai said,
"At this point, after all, I don't understand."8
When the monk related this to Grand Master Ma,9 Master
Ma said, "Tsang's head is white, Hai's head is black."10

realizing it. Ma hides his body but reveals his shadow. Undeni­
ably this old fellow Ma has passed the buck to someone else.
3. He should have pressed Ma. He's stumbled past without realizing

it.
4. The scorched-tail tiger has come out of the weeds. What is he

saying? In fact, the monk is binding himself with straw ropes­
he's totally dead.
5. He's at the disposal of someone else. The first arrow was still

light, but the second arrow is deep.
6. It seems that the eighty-four men of knowledge (produced by Ma

Tsu) all suffer from this kind of sickness.

cries out that he's been wronged.

lessly, forever and ever.

10. In the heart of the realm, the emperor commands; outside the

passes, the generals give orders.

COMMENTARY

In the old days when I studied with Chen Chueh in Ch'eng Tu
(in Szechuan), Chueh said of this case, "You just need to look
at Ma Tsu's first line and you will naturally understand all at
once." Tell me, did this monk understand when he asked, or
did he ask not understanding? This question of his is undeni­
ably profound and far-reaching.
As for going beyond the permutations of assertion and de­
nial, the four basic propositions are: 'it exists,' 'it doesn't exist/
'it neither exist nor doesn't exist,' and 'it both exists and
doesn't exist.' When you depart from these four propositions,
you cut off their hundred negations. But if you just occupy
yourself making up theories, you won't recognize the point of
the story-you'll be looking for your head without seeing it.

If it had been me, I'd have waited until Ma Tsu had spoken,
then unrolled my mat and bowed three times, to see how he
would have responded. If I had been Ma Tsu at that time, when
I saw this monk come up and ask, "Please, Teacher, going
beyond the permutations of affirmation and denial, directly
point out to me the meaning of the coming from the West," I

Seventy-third Case

403

would have brought my staff down across his back and driven
him out with blows, to see if he would awaken or not.
Grand Master Ma just created complications for him. When
this fellow was right in front of it and stumbled past missing it,
Ma Tsu still directed him to go ask Chih Tsang. The monk
really didn't know that Grand Master Ma profoundly discerns
oncoming winds. The monk went in ignorance to ask Chih
Tsang. Tsang said, "Why didn't you ask the Teacher?" The
monk said, "The Teacher had me come here to ask you."
Watch this bit of his: when pressed, he immediately turns
without wasting any more time. Chih Tsang said, "I have a
headache today and can't explain for you. Go ask Elder Brother
Hai."
This monk went to ask Elder Brother Hai, who said, "At this
point, after all, I don't understand." But say, why did one man
say he had a headache and one man say he didn't understand?
In the end, what's what? This monk then came back and re­
lated this to Grand Master Ma. The Master said, "Tsang's head
is white, Hai's head is black."
If you figure this by way of intellectual interpretation, then
you would say that they were fooling the monk. Some say that
is was all just buck-passing. Some say that all three knew the
monk's question, and therefore they didn't answer. All such
interpretations amount to clapping your hands over your eyes
and putting poison into the excellent-flavored pure ghee of the
Ancients.
Thus Ma Tsu said (to Layman P'ang), "When you swallow
all the water in West River in one gulp, then I'll explain to
you." This is the same as the present case. If you can under­
stand "Tsang's head is white, Hai's head is black," then you
can understand this talk about West River's water.
This monk took his load of confusion and exchanged it for
uneasiness: he went on troubling these three adepts, making
them enter the mud and water. In the end this monk didn't
catch a glimpse of it. Although it was like this throughout,
nevertheless these three masters of our school were exposed by
a board-carrying fellow.
People these days just go to the words to make their living.
They say that white refers to merging in brightness, while
black refers to merging in darkness. Just occupying themselves
with pursuing their calculations, such people are far from

404

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

knowing that the ancient Ma Tsu cuts off their i ntellectual
faculties with a single line. You must go to the true lifeline and
look for yourself before you can gain firm accord. Therefore Ma
Tsu said, "With the last word you finally get to the impenetra­
ble barrier." If you cut off the essential crossing place, you
don't let profane or holy pass. If you discuss this matter, it's
like having a sword pressing against your forehead-hesitate
and you lose your body and your life. Again, it's said, "It's like
hurling a sword into the sky-it's not a question of whether it
reaches or not." Just go to the place of glistening clarity to
understand.
Haven't you heard of the Ancients saying "You tub of lac­
quer!" or "Wild fox spirit!" or "Blind man!"? Tell me, is this
the same as, or different from, a blow or a shout? If you know
that the myriad differences and distinctions are all one, then
naturally you will be able to take on opponents on all sides. Do
you want to understand "Tsang's head is white, Hai's head is
black"? My late teacher Wu Tsu said, "Mr. Dustsweeper."
Hsueh Tau's verse says:

VERSE

"Tsang's head is white, Hai's head is black."

Half closed, half open. One hand lifts up, one hand presses
down. The sound of gold bells, the flourish of jewel
chimes.
Clear-eyed patchrobed monks cannot understand.

Go travel for thirty more years. It ends with your nostrils
being pierced by someone else. Because of this, my mouth
seems to be in a frown.
The Colt has trampled everyone on earth to death­
Among all the monasteries, only this old fellow Ma could

do this. Bring this old fellow out!
Lin Chi isn't yet a thief who can steal in broad daylight.

A leper drags along his companions. Even though Ma Tsu
and Lin Chi are experts, they've been caught by another
person, Hsueh Tau.

COMMENTARY

"'Tsang's head is white, Hai's head is black.' " But say, what
does this mean? The world's patchrobed monks can't leap clear
of this little bit. Look at how well Hsueh Tau closes up tight at
the end: he says that even if you're a clear-eyed patchrobed
monk you still won't be able to understand. This bit of news is
called the hidden secret of the spiritual immortals which is not
passed on from father to son. After old Shakyamuni had
preached the teachings of his entire lifetime, at the end he
specially transmitted the mind seal. It is called the Diamond
King's jewel sword;a it is called the Rank of the Correct.b Such
complications were a matter that couldn't be avoided-(with
them) the Ancients showed a little of their sharp point. If you
are a person who can pass through, then you will pierce and
penetrate to attain the great independence. If you can't pass
through, then as before there is no place for you to awaken and
enter, and the more you talk the farther away you are.
"The Colt has trampled everyone on earth to death." Back in
India Prajnatara prophesied to Bodhidharma (of Ma Tsu) saying,
"Though China is vast, there is no other road: it will run in the
footsteps of your descendants. A golden rooster will know how
to take a grain of millet in his beak and offer sustenance to the
arhats of the ten directions."c In addition, the Sixth Patriarch
said to (Ma Tsu's teacher) Master Jang, "Hereafter the Buddha
Dharma will go forth from you. In the future you will produce a
colt who will trample everyone on earth to death." After this
he did spread the teaching over the whole country as the
Dharma successor in Kiangsi-at the time he was called Ma

406

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Tsu. Thus both Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch predicted
Ma Tsu in advance. Look how his way of doing things was, as it
turned out, special-he just said, "Tsang's head is white, Hai's
head is black." This is where to see how he tramples everyone
on earth to death. A thousand men, ten thousand men can't
bite through this one line about black and white.
"Lin Chi isn't yet a thief who can steal in broad daylight."
One day Lin Chi taught his assembly saying, "In this red lump
of flesh there is a true man without station. He's constantly
going in and out through all of your senses. Those who haven't
yet experienced this-look! look!" At the time there was a
monk who came forward and asked, "What is the true man
without station?" Lin Chi came down from the meditation
platform and grabbed the monk tightly saying, "Speak! Speak!"
The monk was speechless. Lin Chi pushed him away and said,
"The true man without station-what a dry piece of shit he
is!" Later Hsueh Feng heard of this and said, "Lin Chi greatly
resembles a thief who steals in broad daylight."
Hsueh Tau wants to meet that Lin Chi, but in observing Ma
Tsu's active edge, it is certainly superior to Lin Chi's. Ma Tsu
is truly a thief who steals in broad daylight; Lin Chi is not yet
one. Hsueh Tau has pierced them both at once.
Turning to versify this monk, Hsueh Tau says, "Going be­
yond the four propositions and cutting off their hundred
negations-/Among gods and humans only I know." But don't
go into the ghost cave to make your living! An Ancient said,
"The question is in the answer, the answer is in the question."
This monk was already extraordinary-how will you be able to
go beyond the four propositions and cut off their hundred nega­
tions? Hsueh Tau says, "Only I know this matter." Even the
Buddhas of past, present, and future cannot catch sight of it.
Since each one must know for himself alone, what are all of
you looking for when you keep on coming up here (to listen to
me)?
Chen Ju of Ta Kuei commented, "This monk asking this
way and Ma Tsu answering this way went beyond the permu­
tations of assertion and denial. Chih Tsang and Elder Brother
Hai didn't realize it at all."
Want to understand? Haven't you heard it said?-"The Colt
has trampled everyone on earth to death."

knows how to crow at the right time, Huai Jang knew when to

Jang, of course, means Ma Tsu: in Chinese, "Ma" means horse.

SEVENTY-FOURTH CASE

Chin Niu's Rice Pail

POINTER

Wielding a sharp sword horizontally, he cuts off the nest of
trailing vines in front of his point. Hanging a clear mirror on
high, he brings forth Vairocana's seal within a phrase. Where
one's state is secure within, one wears clothes and eats food.
Where spiritual powers wander at play, how can one linger?
Have you fully mastered it? Look at what's written below:

CASE

Every day at mealtime, Master Chin Niu would personally
take the rice pail and do a dance in front of the monks' hall:
laughing aloud, he would say, "Bodhisattvas, come eat! "1
Hsueh Tou said, "Though he acted like this, Chin Niu was
not good-hearted."2
A monk asked Ch'ang Ch'ing, "When the man of old said,
'Bodhisattvas, come eat!' what was his meaning? "3 Ch'ing
said, "Much like joyful praise on the occasion of a meal."4

NOTES

1.

"You may play with the fishing line as you will-without dis­
turbing the clear waves, its meaning is naturally distinct." He
applies pure ghee and poison at the same time-and he's right!
Jewels and gems he arrays all at once, but what can he do? -those
he meets with are few.

This is a thief recognizing a thief, a spirit recognizing a spirit. If
someone comes to talk of right and wrong, then he's a right and
wrong person.

ning, he hasn't known where Chin Niu is at. What will Ch'ang

He sizes up the audience to give his order, and wraps up the case
on the basis of the facts.

COMMENTARY

Chin Niu was a venerable adept descended from Ma Tsu. Every
day at mealtime he would personally take the rice pail and do a
dance in front of the monks' hall: laughing aloud, he would
say, "Bodhisattvas, come eat!" He did this for twenty years.
Tell me, where was his intent? Was he just summoning the
others to eat? He always struck the (wooden) fish and beat the
drum (for mealtimes) and also personally announced it. So
what further need was there for him to take the rice pail and do
so many tricks? Wasn't he crazy? Wasn't he "expounding by
design"? If he was expounding this matter, why didn't he
mount the jewel flower throne to "knock on the seat and hold
up the whisk"? Why did he need to act like this?
People today are far from knowing that the Ancients' mean­
ing was outside of words. Why not then take a brief look at the
stated purpose for the Patriarchal Teacher's first coming here?
What was it? It was clearly explained: for a separate transmis­
sion outside the verbal teachings, to transmit individually the
mind seal. The ancient man Chin Niu's expedient methods too
were just to make you directly receive this. Later people would
vainly calculate on their own and say, "Why so many con­
cerns? When cold, tum toward the fire; when hot, take advan­
tage of the cool shade; when hungry, eat; when tired, get some
sleep." If we interpreted meanings this way, on the basis of
ordinary feelings, to explain and comment, then the whole
school of Bodhidharma would have been wiped off the face of
the earth. Don't you realize that twenty-four hours a day, from
moment to moment, the Ancients never gave up wanting to
understand This Matter?
Hsueh Tou said, "Though he acted like this, Chin Niu was
not good-hearted." Many people misunderstand this line. That
which is called the supreme flavor of pure ghee is converted, on
encountering such people, into poison. Since Chin Niu de­
scended into the weeds to help people, why did Hsueh Tou say
that he wasn't good-hearted? Why did he talk this way? Patch­
robed monks must have living potential to begin to understand
this.

410

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

People today don't get to the Ancient's realm-they just say,
"What mind is there to see? What Buddha is there?" If you
construct such views you have destroyed the old adept, Chin
Niu. It takes thorough observation to begin to understand. If
today and tomorrow you go on with such facile explanations,
you'll never be finished.
Later when Ch'ang Ch'ing had gone up to his seat, a monk
asked, "When the ancient man said, 'Bodhisattvas, come eat!'
what was his meaning?" Ch'ing said, "Much like joyful praise
on the occasion of a meal." The honored worthy Ch'ang Ch'ing
was extremely compassionate-he leaked and tarried quite a
bit. In truth it was "joyful praise on the occasion of a meal."
But you tell me, rejoicing over what?
Look at Hsueh Tau's verse which says:

VERSE

Laughing aloud in the shadow of the white clouds,

In his laugh, there's a knife. Why the enthusiasm? The
world's patchrobed monks don't know where he comes
down.
He lifts it up with both hands to give to them.

How can there be such things? Better not slander Chin
Niu! Can it be called a rice pail? If you are a legitimate
patchrobed monk in your own right, you don't eat this
kind of food.
If they were sons of the golden-haired lion,

They must first be beyond patterns. I'll allow that they
had eyes, but I only fear that their eyes were not true.
They would have seen the deception from three thousand
miles away.
It wasn't worth half a cent. A scene of leaking and tarry­

ing. Where was the deception? Blind men!

COMMENTARY

"Laughing aloud in the shadow of the white clouds." Ch'ang
Ch'ing says, "Joyful praise on the occasion of a meal." Hsueh

Seventy-fourth Case

411

Tau says, "He lifts it up with both hands to give to them." But
say, was he just giving them food to eat, or do you think that
there must have been something special besides? If you can
know the true point here, then you're a son of the golden­
haired lion. If they had been sons of the golden-haired lion,
then there would have been no more need for Chin Niu to take
the rice pail, do a dance, and laugh aloud-in fact they would
have known his mistake immediately from three thousand
miles away.
An Ancient said, "Perceive before the act and you won't
have to use the least bit of effort." Thus patchrobed monks
must always function outside of patterns before they can be
called genuine Masters of our school. If they just base them­
selves on words and speech, they won't avoid leaking and tarry­
ing in indulgent attachments.

SEVENTY-FIFTH CASE

Wu Chiu's Unjust Beating

POINTER

The subtle point, the jewel sword, perpetually revealed, pre­
sent in front of us. It can kill people and it can bring people life.
It's there and it's here, gaining and losing together with us. If
you want to pick it up, you're free to pick it up; if you want to
put it down, you're free to put it down.
But say, what's it like when not falling into guest and host,
when interchanging without getting stuck? To test, I'm citing
this old case: look!

CASE

A monk came to Wu Chiu from the congregation of the Master
of Ting Chou. Wu Chiu asked, "How does Ting Chou's
Dharma Path compare to here? "1 The monk said, "It's not
different."2 Chiu said, "If it's not different, then you should go
back there," and then hit him.3 The monk said, "There are eyes
on the staff: you shouldn't carelessly hit people."4 Chiu said,
"Today I've hit one," and hit him again three times.5 The
monk thereupon went out.6
Chiu said, "All along there's been someone receiving an
unjust beating."7 The monk turned around and said, "What can
I do? The handle is in your hands, Teacher."8 Chiu said, "If you
want, I'll tum it over to you."9 The monk came up to Chiu,
grabbed the staff out of his hands, and hit him three times.10
Chiu said, "An unjust beating, an unjust beating! "11 The monk

said, "There's someone receiving it."12

Chiu said, "I hit this fellow carelessly."13 Immediately the
monk bowed.14 Chiu said, "Yet you act this way."15 The monk
laughed loudly and went out.16 Chiu said, "That's all it comes
to, that's all it comes to."17

NOTES
1. There's an echo in his words. He must distinguish shallow from

deep. (The question is like) a probing pole, a reed shade. He's
really deceiving the man!
2. Among the dead men there's a live one. One or a half. ("Not

different") is the same as an iron spike. He's treading upon the
ground of reality.
3. Obviously. The correct imperative must be carried out.
4. Only this adept could do this. After all, he's a lion cub.
5. What one is he talking about? (Why not hit) a thousand, ten

thousand?
6. All along the monk's been a man of our house. In fact he has been

wronged. He just sees his opportunity and goes.
7. A mute eating a bitter melon. Chiu both lets go and gathers in.
What good is someone who turns back around when hit?
8. It's this way three hundred and sixty-five days a year. After all he

is a clever patchrobed monk.
9. Who knows which of them is the prince and which is the minis­

ter? Chiu dares to lie down in the tiger's mouth. He really doesn't
know good from evil.
10. Here again, only an adept Ch'an traveller could do this. Guest and

host interchange, releasing or capturing according to the occa­
sion.
11. Check! Why is this old fellow in such a rush?

12. Haha! How many handles are now in this monk's hands?
13. It doesn't come down on either side. Who knows who he is?
14. Only one who doesn't flinch when faced with danger is a man of
power.
15. Check!
16. An adept Ch'an traveller naturally has (such ability). A fierce tiger

must have a pure wind following him. Now we know that he
finished the beginning and finished the end. No one on earth can
get a grasp on him.
1 7. Too bad he let the monk go. Why didn't he bring his staff down
across his back? Where do you think the monk went?

COMMENTARY

A monk came to Wu Chiu from the congregation of the Master
of Ting Chou. Chiu was also an adept. If here all of you people

414

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

can realize that there was a single exit and a single entry for
these two men, then a thousand or ten thousand is in fact just
one. It is so, whether acting as host or as guest: in the end the
two men merge together into one agent for one session of care­
ful investigation. Whether as guest or host, whether asking or
answering, from beginning to end both were adepts.
Look at Wu Chiu questioning this monk: "How does Ting
Chou's Dharma Path compare to here?" The monk im­
mediately said, "It's not different." At the time, if it hadn't
been Wu Chiu, it would have been hard to cope with this
monk. Chiu said, "If it's not different, then you should go back
there," and then hit him. But what could he do? This monk
was an adept and immediately said, "There are eyes on the
staff: you shouldn't carelessly hit people." Chiu carried out the
imperative thoroughly saying, "Today I've hit one," and hit­
ting him again three more times. At this the monk went out.
Observe how the two of them revolved so smoothly-both
were adepts. To understand this affair it is necessary to distin­
guish initiate from lay, and tell right from wrong. Though this
monk went out, the case was still not finished.
From beginning to end Wu Chiu wanted to test this monk's
reality, to see how he was. But this monk had barred the door,
so Chiu hadn't yet seen him. Then Wu Chiu said, "All along
there's been someone receiving an unjust beating." This monk
wanted to turn around and show some life, yet he didn't strug­
gle with Wu Chiu, but turned around most easily and said,
"What can I do? The handle is in your hands, Teacher." Being a
Master of our school with an eye on his forehead, Wu Chiu
dared to lay his body down in the fierce tiger's mouth and say,
"If you want, I'll turn it over to you."
This monk was a fellow with a talisman under his arm. As it
is said, "To see what is right and not do it is lack of bravery."
Without hesitating any longer, the monk came up to Wu Chiu,
grabbed the staff out of his hands, and hit him three times.
When Chiu said, "An unjust beating, an unjust beating!" tell
me, what did he mean? Before, Chiu said, "All along there's
been someone receiving an unjust beating." But when the
monk hit him he said, "An unjust beating, an unjust beating!"
When the monk said, "There's someone receiving it," Chiu
said, "I hit this fellow carelessly." Chiu said before that he had
hit a person carelessly. Afterwards, when he had taken a beat-

Seventy-fifth Case

415

ing himself, why did he also say, "I hit this fellow carelessly"?
If it hadn't been for this monk's independent resurgence, he
couldn't have been able to handle Wu Chiu.
Then the monk bowed. This bow was extremely poison­
ous--it wasn't good-hearted. If it hadn't been Wu Chiu, he
wouldn't have been able to see through this monk. Wu Chiu
said to him, "Yet you act this way." The monk laughed loudly
and went out. Wu Chiu said, "That's all it comes to, that's all it
comes to."
Observe how all through the meeting of these adepts, guest
and host are distinctly clear. Though cut off, they can still
continue. In fact this is just an action of interchanging. Yet
when they get here, they do not say that there is an inter­
change. Since these ancient men were beyond defiling feelings
and conceptual thinking, neither spoke of gain or loss. Though
it was a single session of talk, the two men were both leaping
with life, and both had the needle and thread of our blood line.
If you can see here, you too will be perfectly clear twenty-four
hours a day.
When the monk (first) went out, this was both sides letting
go. What happened after that was both sides gathering in. This
is called interchanging. Hsueh Tou makes his verse just this
way:

VERSE

To summon is easyEveryone on earth doubts this. Rancid meat attracts flies.
None of the world's patchrobed monks know where this
comes down.
To send away is hard.
Getting rid of them thoroughly (is hard). Mirages appear
over the sea.
Observe carefully the interchange of action points.
One exit, one entry-both are adepts. Two men hold a
single staff. But say, whose side is it on?
The rock of ages though solid can still crumbleHow will you handle the golden hammer up his sleeve?
The thousand sages haven't transmitted it.

416

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

When they stand in its depths the ocean must dry up.
Where will this be arranged? There are eyes on the staff.

I'll only allow that they have attained intimately.
Old Wu Chiu! Old Wu Chiu!

What a pity that this old fellow doesn't know good from
evil.
How many kinds!

He's another fellow with no reasons (for what he does).
Hundreds, thousands, myriads of miles.
Indeed he had no reason for giving him the handle.

Already so before the words. Wu Chiu's life was hanging
by a thread. He deserves thirty blows. But say, where was
his fault?

COMMENTARY

"To summon is easy-to send away is hard." It's all falling into
the weeds. With his excessive compassion, Hsueh Tou would
often say, "Calling snakes is easy; sending snakes away is
hard." Right now if I were to take a (dried and hollow) gourd
and blow through it, it would be easy to summon snakes, but
when I wanted to send them away it would be hard. Similarly,
it's easy to give one's staff to someone else, but to take it back
from him and send him away is hard. You must have your own
ability-only then will you be able to send him away.
Wu Chiu was an adept with the skill to call snakes and also
the ability to send snakes away. This monk wasn't asleep
either. When Wu Chiu asked, "How does Ting Chou's Dharma
Path compare to here? "-this was calling him. When Wu Chiu
then hit him, this was sending him away. When the monk said,
"There are eyes on the staff:

you shouldn't hit people

carelessly"-this is the summoning transferred over to the
monk's side. When Wu Chiu said, "If you want, I'll turn it over
to you," and the monk then came up to Chiu, grabbed the staff
out of his hands, and hit him three times-this was the monk
sending him away. As for the monk laughing loudly and going
out, and Wu Chiu saying, "That's all it comes to"-this clearly
is each sending the other away appropriately.
Observe how these two exchanged action points, spinning
with perfect continuity, fusing into one whole. From beginning

to end, guest and host are clearly distinct. Sometimes, though,
host acts as guest and sometimes guest acts as host. Even
Hsueh Tau cannot praise this enough. Thus he speaks of the
act of interchange and has you people observe it carefully.
"The rock of ages though solid can still crumble." He speaks
of this "rock of ages": it's 84,000 leagues wide and 84,000
leagues thick.a Every five hundred years a god comes down and
brushes across it with a gossamer cloth, then departs for an­
other five hundred years. The brushing continues like this
until it wears the rock away-this makes one age called the
"light cloth brushing across the rock" age. Hsueh Tau says,
"The rock of ages though solid can still crumble." Though the
rock is strong and solid, still it can be worn away to nothing.
But the action point of these two men can never be obliterated
over the ages.
"When they stand in its depths the ocean must dry up."
Even the ocean, with its vast swelling billows flooding the
skies, even the very ocean would inevitably dry up utterly if
you have these two men stand within it. At this point Hsueh
Tau has completed his verse all at once.
At the end he goes on to say, "Old Wu Chiu! Old Wu
Chiu!/How many kinds?" Sometimes catching, sometimes let­
ting go; sometimes killing, sometimes giving life-in the end,
how many kinds is this? "Indeed he had no reason for giving
him the handle." This staff has been used by all the Buddhas of
past, present, and future, and by the successive generations of
Patriarchal Teachers, and by the Masters of our school, to pull
out nails and extract pegs for people, to loosen what is stuck
and untie what is bound. How can it be given over to someone
else lightly? Hsueh Tau means that it should be used by one­
self alone. Fortunately it happened that this monk then just
opened up to him-if he had suddenly stirred up thunder over
dry ground, we would have observed how Chiu met it. When
Wu Chiu passed him the handle, wasn't this indeed without
any reason?

SEVENTY-SIXTH CASE

Tan Hsia's Have You Eaten Yet?

POINTER

Fine as rice powder, cold as icy frost, it blocks off heaven and
earth and goes beyond light and dark. Observe it where it's low
and there's extra; level it off where it's high and there's not
enough. Holding fast and letting go are both here, but is there a
way to appear or not? To test I'm citing this old case: look!

CASE

Tan Hsia asked a monk, "Where have you come from? "1 The
monk said, "From down the mountain."2 Hsia said, "Have you
eaten yet or not? "3 The monk said, "I have eaten."4 Hsia said,
"Did the person who brought you the food to eat have eyes or
not? "5 The monk was speechless.6
Ch'ang Ch'ing asked Pao Fu, "To give someone food to eat is
ample requital of the debt of kindness: why wouldn't he have
eyes? "7 Fu said, "Giver and receiver are both blind."8 Ch'ang
Ch'ing said, "If they exhausted their activity, would they still
turn out blind? "9 Fu said, "Can you say that I'm blind?"10

NOTES
1. It's truly impossible to have no place at all you've come from. If

he wants to know where he's come from, it won't be hard.
2. He has put on his straw sandals and walked into your belly. It's

just that you don't understand. There's an echo in his words, but
he keeps it to himself. Is he yellow or green?
3. A second ladleful of foul water douses the monk. Why just the

zero point of a scale? He wants to know the real truth.
4. As it turns out, he's collided with the pillar. After all, he's had his

nostrils pierced by a bystander. From the beginning it's been an
iron hammer head with no handle hole.

418

Seventy-sixth Case

419

5. Although he is relying on his power to mystify the man, he is also

wrapping up the case on the basis of the facts. At the time he
deserved to have his meditation seat overturned. Why is there no
reason for what he did?
6. After all, he couldn't

run .

If this monk had been an adept he

would have said to him, "The same as your eyes, Teacher."
7. He's still only said half. Is it "throughout the body" or is it "all

over the body"? One cut, two pieces. One hand lifts up, one hand
presses down.
8. He acts according to the imperative. With one line he says it all.

Such a man is rarely encountered.
9. What does he know of good and evil? He still isn't settled himself:

what bowl is he looking for?
10. The two of them are both in the weeds. Fu has a dragon's head but

a snake's tail. At the time when he said, "If they had exhausted
their activity, would they still turn out blind?" I would have just
said to him, "You're blind." Since they're both adepts, why is it
that "ahead they didn't reach the village, behind they didn't get to
the shop"?

COMMENTARY

"Tan Hsia" was Ch'an Master T'ien Jan of Tan Hsia in Teng
Province of Honan-1 don't know what locality he was from.
At first he studied Confucianism, intending to go to Ch'ang-an
to take part in the examinations for official posts. Then unex­
pectedly while he was staying over at a travellers' lodge, he
dreamed that a white light filled the room. A diviner said,
"This is an auspicious omen of understanding emptiness."
There happened to be a Ch'an traveller there who asked him,
"Good man, where are you going?" He said, "To be chosen to
be an official." The Ch'an traveller said, "How can choosing an
official career compare to choosing Buddhahood?" Tan Hsia
asked, "What place should I go to to choose Buddhahood?" The
Ch'an traveller said, "At the present time Grand Master Ma
has appeared in the world in Kiangsi. This is the place to
choose Buddhahood-you should go there, good man."
After this Tan Hsia went directly to Kiangsi. The moment
he saw Grand Master Ma he lifted up the edge of his turban (to
look at Ma). Master Ma observed him and said, "I am not your

420

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Teacher-go to Shih T'ou's place in Nan Yueh." Tan Hsia
hastened to Nan Yueh where he submitted to Shih T'ou with
the same idea as before (at Ma Tsu's place). Shih T'ou told him
to go to the stable, and Tan Hsia bowed in thanks. He entered
the workmen's hall and worked along with the congregation
for three years.
One day Shih T'ou announced to the assembly, "Tomorrow
we're going to clear away the weeds in front of the Buddha's
shrine." The next day everyone equipped himself with a hoe to
cut down the weeds. Tan Hsia alone took a bowl, filled it with
water, and washed his headi then he knelt in front of Master
Shih T'ou. Shih T'ou saw this and laughed at him, then shaved
his head for him. As Shih T'ou began to explain the precepts for
him, Tan Hsia covered his ears and went out.
Then Tan Hsia headed for Kiangsi to call again on Ma Tsu.
Before meeting with Ma Tsu to pay his respects, he went into
the monks' hall and sat astride the neck of the holy statue (of
Manjusri). At the time everybody became very perturbed and
hurried to report this to Ma Tsu. Tsu personally went to the
hall to have a look at him and said, "My son is so natural."
Hsia immediately got down and bowed saying, "Thank you,
Master, for giving me a Dharma name." Because of this he was
called T'ien Jan (which means natural). This man of old Tan
Hsia was naturally sharply outstanding like this. As it is said,
"Choosing officialdom isn't as good as choosing Buddhahood."
His sayings are recorded in the Records of the Transmission of
the Lamp.
His words tower up like a thousand-fathom wall. Each and

every line has the ability to pull out nails and extract pegs for
people, like when he asked this monk, "Where have you come
from?" The monk said, "From down the mountain," yet he
didn't communicate where he had come from. It seemed that
he had eyes and was going to reverse things and examine the
host. If it hadn't been Tan Hsia, it would have been impossible
to gather him in.
But Tan Hsia said, "Have you eaten yet or not?" At first he
hadn't been able to see this monk at all, so this is the second
attempt to examine him. The monk said, "I have eaten." From
the beginning this confused and ignorant fellow hadn't under­
stood. Hsia said, "Did the person who brought you the food to

Seventy-sixth Case

421

eat have eyes or not?" and the monk was speechless. Tan
Hsia's meaning was, "What's the use of giving food to such a
fellow as you?" If this monk had been a fellow (with eyes) he
would have given Tan Hsia a poke to see what he would do.
Nevertheless, Tan Hsia still didn't let him go, so the monk was
(left standing there) blinking stupidly and speechless.
When Pao Fu and Ch'ang Ch'ing were together in Hsueh
Feng's congregation, they would often bring up the public cases
of the Ancients to discuss. Ch'ang Ch'ing asked Pao Fu, "To
give someone food is ample requital of kindness: why wouldn't
he have eyes?" He didn't have to inquire exhaustively into the
facts of the case; he could take it all in using these words to
pose his question. He wanted to test Pao Fu's truth. Pao Fu
said, "Giver and receiver are both blind." How direct! Here he
just discusses the immediate circumstances-inside his house
Pao Fu has a way to assert himself.
When Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "If they had exhausted their ac­
tivity, would they still turn out blind?" Pao Fu said, "Can you
say that I'm blind?" Pao Fu meant, "I have such eyes to have
said it all to you-are you still saying I'm blind?" Neverthe­
less, it's half closed and half open. At that time if it had been
me, when he said, "If they had exhausted their activity, would
they still turn out blind?" I would have just said to him,
"You're blind." What a pity! If Pao Fu had uttered this one
word "blind" at that time, he would have avoided so many of
Hsueh Tau's complications. Hsueh Tou too just uses this idea
to make his verse:

VERSE

(Ch'ang Ch'ing) exhausts his activity, (Pao Fu) doesn't become
blindThey've only said half. Each wanted to test the other. The
words are still in our ears.
(Like) holding down an ox's head to make it eat grass.
They lose their money and incur punishment. Half south
of the river, half north of the river. Without realizing it,
they've run afoul of the point and cut their hands.

422

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Twenty-eight and six PatriarchsIf you have a rule, hold on to the rule. Hsueh Tou is
dragging down the former sages; he doesn't just involve
one man.
Their precious vessel is brought forth, but it turns out to be an
error.
Everyone on earth beats his breast (in sorrow). Give me
back my staff. They've dragged me down so that I can't
even show my face.
The error is profoundExtremely profound. The world's patchrobed monks can­
not leap clear of it. But tell me, how profound?
There's no place to look for it.
Though it's right beneath your feet, it can't be found.
Gods and humans sink down together on dry land.
The world's patchrobed monks are all buried in one pit. Is
there anyone alive? I let my move go. Heavens! Heavens!

COMMENTARY

"(Ch'ang Ch'ing) exhausts his activity, (Pao Fu) doesn't become
blind." Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "If they exhausted their activity,
would they still tum out blind?" Pao Fu said, "Can you say
that I'm blind?" This was all like "Holding down an ox's head
to make it eat grass." To get it right you must wait till he eats
on his own: how can you push down an ox's head and make
him eat? When Hsueh Tou versifies like this, naturally we can
see Tan Hsia's meaning.
"Twenty-eight and six Patriarchs-/Their precious vessel is
brought forth, but it turns out to be an error." Not only does
Hsueh Tou drag down Ch'ang Ch'ing, but at the same time he
buries the twenty-eight Patriarchs of India and the six Pa­
triarchs

of

this

country.

In

forty-nine

years,

old

man

Shakyamuni preached the whole great treasurehouse of the
Teachings; at the end he only transmitted this precious vessel.
Yung Chia said, "This is not an empty exhibition displaying
form: it's the actual traces of the Tathagata's jewel staff." If
you adopt Pao Fu's view, then even if you bring forth the pre­
cious vessel, it all turns out to be an error.

Seventy-sixth Case

423

"The error is profound-/There's no place to look for it."
This can't be explained for you: just go sit quietly and inquire
into his lines and see. Since the error is profound, why then is
there no place to look for it? This is not a small mistake: he
takes the Great Affair of the Buddhas and Patriarchs and sub­
merges it entirely on dry land. Hence Hsueh Tau says, "Gods
and humans sink down together on dry land."

SEVENTY-SEVENTH CASE

Yun Men's Cake

POINTER

Turning upwards, he can pierce the nostrils of everyone on
earth, like a falcon catching a pigeon. Turning downwards, his
own nostrils are in the hands of other people, like a turtle
hiding in its shell.
Here if someone suddenly comes forth and says, "Funda­
mentally, there is no upwards and downwards-what use is
turning?" I simply say to him, "I know that you are going
inside the ghost cave to make your living."
But say, how will you distinguish initiate from naive? After
a silence, Yuan Wu said, "If you have precepts, go by the pre­
cepts; if you have no precepts, go by the example."

COMMENTARY

This monk asked Yun Men, "What is talk that goes beyond
Buddhas and Patriarchs?" Men said, "Cake." Do you feel your
hairs standing on end with the chill? Patchrobed monks have
asked about Buddhas and asked about Patriarchs, asked about
Ch'an and asked about Tao, asked about facing upwards and
facing downwards-there's nothing more that can be asked,
424

Seventy-seventh Case

425

yet this one posed a question and asked about talk that goes
beyond Buddhas and Patriarchs. Yun Men was an adept: thus,
when the water rises, the boats ride high, and when there is
much mud the Buddha-image is big. So he answered saying
"Cake." It can be said that the Way is not carried out in vain,
that his effort is not wasted.
Yun Men also taught the assembly saying, "Without any
understanding, when you see people talking about the intent of
the Patriarchal Teachers you immediately ask for theories of
talk that goes beyond Buddhas and Patriarchs. But what do you
call 'Buddhas,' what do you call 'Patriarchs,' that you im­
mediately speak of talk that transcends Buddhas and Pa­
triarchs? Then you ask about escape from the triple world, but
you take hold of the triple world to see. What seeing, hearing,
feeling,

and

knowing

are

there

to

hinder

you?

What

phenomena of sound and form are there that you can be made
to understand? What 'bowl' do you know how to use? On what
basis do you entertain views of differentiations? Those ancient
sages can't do anything for you, though they extend themselves
to help living beings. Even if they say that the whole Body is
entirely real, that in everything we see the Essence-t�1is is
ungraspable. When I say to you, 'In fact, what concerns are
there?' this has already buried it." If you can understand this
statement, then you can recognize the "Cake."
Wu Tsu said, "Donkey shit is like horse shit." This is what
Yung Chia called "Going direct to the root source, as the Bud­
dhas have sealed-picking through

leaves and searching

through twigs I cannot do." When you get to this point, if you
want to attain Intimacy, don't ask with questions.
Observe how this monk asked, "What is talk that goes be­
yond Buddhas and Patriarchs? " and Yun Men said, "Cake."
Does Yun Men know shame? Is he aware of indulging? There's
a type of phoney person who says, "Yun Men saw the rabbit
and released the hawk; thus he said 'Cake."' If you take such a
view, that "Cake" is talk that goes beyond Buddhas and Pa­
triarchs, how can there be a living road? Don't understand it as
cake and don't understand it as going beyond Buddhas and
Patriarchs-this, then, is the living road. (Yun Men's "Cake")
is the same as (Tung Shan's) "Three pounds of hemp" (Case
and (Ho Shan's) "Knowing how to beat the drum" (Case
though he just said "Cake," its reality is hard to see.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Later people often made up rationalizations and said,
"Coarse words and subtle talk all come back to the primary
truth." If you understand in this fashion, just go be a lecturer
and spend your life collecting much knowledge and many in­
terpretations. Followers of Ch'an these days say, "When you go
beyond the Buddhas and Patriarchs you are trampling both
Buddhas and Patriarchs underfoot-that's why Yun Men just
said to him, 'Cake."' Since it's "Cake," how does this explain
going beyond the Buddhas and Patriarchs? Try to investigate
thoroughly and see.
In the various places the verses about this case are extremely
numerous, but they all go to the side of the question to make
their comment. Hsueh Tau alone has versified it the best­
naturally he's outstanding. The verse says:

VERSE

Ch'an travellers asking about transcendent talk are especially
numerous.
One after another they come forth and make up this kind

of view, (numerous as) hemp or millet.
His gap opens-see W
Already open before the words. Hsueh Tou doesn't notice

the smell of his own shit.
Even the cake stuffed in doesn't stop him.

He's replaced your eyes with wooden beads.
Up till now there has been confusion all over the world.

I'll draw a circle and say, "Haven't you been understand­
ing this way?" What end is there to chewing over the
words of others? The great earth is desolate, killing people
with sadness, so I'll hit.

COMMENTARY

"Ch'an travellers asking about transcendent talk are especially
numerous." Followers of Ch'an are especially fond of asking
about this saying ("talk that goes beyond Buddhas and Pa­
triarchs"). Haven't you heard? Yun Men said, "All of you carry

Seventy-seventh Case

427

a staff across your shoulders and say, 'I am immersed in medi­
tation, I am studying the Path,' and then go looking for a truth
that goes beyond the Buddhas and Patriarchs. But I ask you,
during the twenty-four hours of the day, when walking, stand­
ing, sitting, and lying down; when shitting and pissing among
the vermin in a roadside privy; when at the counter of the
butcher's stall in the market; is there still any truth that goes
beyond the Buddhas and Patriarchs? Let those who can speak of
it come forward. If there isn't anyone (who can), then don't stop
me from acting this way and that as I please." Then Yun Men
went down from his seat.
Some can no longer tell right from wrong-they draw a cir­
cle, adding mud to dirt, putting on chains while wearing
stocks. "His gap opens-see it?" What a big gap there is in this
monk posing his question! Yun Men saw it opening up in his
question, so he said "Cake" to block it up tight. But this monk
still wouldn't agree to stop-instead, he went on asking. Thus
Hsueh Tou says, "Even the cake stuffed in doesn't stop him."
"Up till now there has been confusion all over the world."
Followers of Ch'an these days just go to "Cake" to understand,
or else they go to "beyond Buddhas and Patriarchs" to make up
theories. Since it's not in these two places, in the end, where is
it? Thirty years from now, when I've exchanged my bones, I'll
tell you.

COMMENTARY

At the Surangama Assembly, Bhadrapala and the sixteen
bodhisattvas all practiced pure conduct and each related the
basis on which he had experienced the Dharma gate of perfect
pervasiveness. This is numbered as one among twenty-five
(kinds of) perfect pervasiveness. (They related that) when it was
time for monks to bathe they had filed in to bathe and suddenly
awakened to the basis of water. Since they didn't wash off the
dirt, and they didn't wash their bodies, tell me, what did they
wash? If you can understand, then, at peace within, you realize
428

Seventy-eighth Case

429

the absence of anything existing. Then a thousand or ten
thousand will no longer be able to get near you. As it is said,
"Absence of attainment is true wisdomi if there is something
which is attained, this is just semblance wisdom."
Haven't you heard? Bodhidharma said to the Second Pa­
triarch, "Bring out your mind and I will pacify it for you." The
Second Patriarch said, "When I search for my mind, I can't find
it." This little bit here is the basic root of patchrobed monks'
lives. There's no more need at all for so many complications:
all that's needed is to speak of suddenly awakening to the basis
of water, and you spontaneously understand properly.
Since they didn't wash off the dust, and they didn't wash
their bodies, tell me, what did they awaken to? When you get
to this realm, nothing at all is applicable-even the word
"Buddha" must be avoided. They said, "Subtle feeling reveals
illumination, and we have achieved the station of sons of
Buddha." "Reveals" means "makes apparent." The subtle feel­
ing is illumination. Once you awaken to the subtle feeling,
then you achieve the station of sons of Buddha, that is, you are
in the stage of Buddhahood.
People these days also go in to bathe, they also wash in
water and feel it this way. Why then don't they awaken? They
are all confused and obstructed by the objects of the senses:
they stick to their skins and cling to their bones. That's why
they can't wake up immediately then and there. Here, if there's
nothing attained in washing or feeling or in the basis of water,
then tell me, is this "Subtle feeling reveals illumination" or
not? If here you can see directly, then this is "Subtle feeling
reveals illumination, and we achieve the station of sons of
Buddha." People these days feel too, but do they perceive its
subtlety? Subtle feeling is not ordinary feeling and feeler,
where conta.:t is considered feeling and separation is not.
When Hsuan Sha was crossing the mountains and stubbed
his toe (thereupon awakening), when Te Shan hits-isn't this
subtle feeling? Although it is so, to realize this you must be
extremely piercing and penetrating. If you just search on your
body, what connection is there? If you are extremely piercing
and penetrating, then what need is there to go in and wash?
You will make the jewel king's realm appear on the tip of a hair
and tum the great Dharma Wheel in every speck of dust. If you
can penetrate in one place, then you penetrate a thousand
places, ten thousand places all at once. Don't just hold onto

430

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

a single nook or den-all places are the gates by which
Avalokitesvara enters the truth.
For the Ancients too there was "awakening to the Path by
hearing sounds, illuminating Mind by seeing forms." If a single
man awakens, this is the reason. But why did the sixteen
bodhisattvas awaken at the same time? Because the Ancients
practiced together and experienced together, awakened to­
gether and understood together. Hsueh Tou picks up the mean­
ing of their teaching to make people go to where "Subtle feel­
ing reveals illumination" to understand. But Hsueh Tou goes
beyond the eye of their teaching to let people avoid being
trapped within the net of the teaching, half-drunk and half­
sober. He wants to make people directly become clean, free,
and unbound. The verse says:

VERSE

I only need one patchrobed monk who understands this matterThere's one right here. I'll give him three thousand blows
in the morning and eight hundred blows at night. Leap
out of the unbreakable trap! Not even one is needed.
Stretch out your legs on the long-bench and lie down.
After all he's a sleepyhead. For eons he never discusses

Ch'an.
In a dream you once spoke of awakening to perfect pervasivenessAlready asleep, he goes on to speak of dreams. Yet I'll

allow that he has seen it in dreams. Why the talking in his
sleep?
Though you've washed in fragrant water, I'll spit right in your
face.
Bah! He adds another layer of mud on top of the dirt.

Don't come and shit on the clean ground!

COMMENTARY

"I only need one patchrobed monk who understands this mat­
ter." But say, understands what matter? Once they hear it

Seventy-eighth Case

431

mentioned, adept Ch'an travellers immediately go carry it out.
It just takes one such patchrobed monk-what's the use of
forming a crowd?
"Stretch out your legs on the long-bench and lie down." An
Ancient said, "In clear illumination, there is no such thing as
awakening. (The concept of) 'having awakened' turns around
and deludes people. When you stretch out both feet and sleep,
there's no false and there's no true-thus, there isn't a single
concern in one's heart. When hungry, one eats; when tired, one
sleeps."
Hsueh Tou means that if you speak of going in to wash and
awakening to "Subtle feeling reveals illumination," from the
standpoint of this kind of unconcerned patchrobed monk, this
is just like speaking of a dream in a dream. That's why Hsueh
Tou says, "In a dream you once spoke of awakening to perfect
pervasiveness-Though you've washed in fragrant water, I'll
spit right in your face." Though it seems like fragrant water, in
fact it's foul water suddenly soaking your head. What "perfect
pervasiveness" can you go on talking about? Hsueh Tou says
that this sort of fellow quite rightly gets his face spattered with
spit. I say that this is adding another layer of mud on top of dirt.

A hit! It won't do to let him go. He should be hit-why does T'ou
Tzu stop before his staff is broken?

COMMENTARY

T'ou Tzu was plain and truthful; he had the eloquence which
stood out from the crowd. Whenever a question was put to
him, you saw his guts as soon as he opened his mouth. Without
expending superfluous effort, he would immediately cut off the
questioner's tongue. It could be said that, setting his plans in
motion from within his headquarters tent, he decided victory
beyond a thousand miles. This monk had taken his views of
sound and form Buddhism and stuck them to his forehead:
whenever he met someone, he would immediately ask about
it. But T'ou Tzu, an adept, profoundly discerns oncoming
winds.
Knowing that T'ou Tzu wa� truthful, this monk from the
start was making a trap for him to go into-hence his sub­
sequent remarks. Nevertheless it was T'ou Tzu who used the
tiger trap to fish out the monk's subsequent words. This monk
received T'ou Tzu's answer by saying, "Teacher, doesn't your
asshole make farting sounds?" As it turned out, as soon as T'ou
Tzu set his hook, the monk immediately climbed onto it. Any­
one else would have been unable to handle this monk, but T'ou
Tzu had the eye and followed up behind and hit him. Such
"hound biting a boar" ability is only possible for an adept.
Whether he turned to the left or to the right, T'ou Tzu followed
him, turning smoothly. When this monk made a trap, wanting
to grab the tiger's whiskers, he was far from knowing that T'ou
Tzu was above his trap and would hit him. Too bad for this
monk-he had a head but no tail. As soon as T'ou Tzu picked
up his staff, the monk should have overturned his meditation
seat. Then even if T'ou Tzu had used his full capacity, he still
would have had to fall back three thousand miles.

434

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

The monk also asked, "Coarse words or subtle talk, all re­
turns to the primary meaning-right or wrong?" Again T'ou
Tzu said, "Right." This is just like his previous answeri there is
no difference. When the monk said, "Can I call you an ass,
Teacher?" T'ou Tzu again hit him. Although this monk was
making himself a nest, nevertheless he was still exceptional. If
the old fellow up on the carved wood seat had been without an
eye on his forehead, it would have been impossible for him to
crush this monk. But T'ou Tzu did have a place to tum around.
When this monk made up a theory, he wanted to plunder T'ou
Tzu's shopi but in the end, as before, he couldn't cope with the
old fellow.
Haven't you seen Yen T'ou's saying? "In battle each one
occupies a pivotal position." T'ou Tzu let go very slowly and
gathered in very swiftly. At the time, if this monk had known
how to tum himself around and show some life, wouldn't he
have been able to act as a man with a mouth like a bowl of
blood? A patchrobed monk either doesn't act or (once he be­
gins) doesn't quit. Since this monk was unable to spring back,
his nostrils were pierced by T'ou Tzu. The verse says:

VERSE

T'ou Tzu! T'ou Tzu!
Obviously there's no one on earth like this truthful old
fellow. He spoils the sons and daughters of other people's
families.
The wheel of his ability is unobstructed.

indeed.

and you'll still get a beating. If you take this monk's place,
I'll hit you.

said, "Where the wheel of his ability turns the actor is still

entirely without obstructions.
Thus Hsueh Tou says, "He releases one and gets two."
Haven't you heard? A monk asked, "What is Buddha?" T'ou
Tzu said, "Buddha." Again he asked, "What is the Path?" T'ou
Tzu said, "The Path." Again he asked, "What is Ch'an?" T'ou
Tzu said, "Ch'an." He also asked, "How is it when the moon is
not yet full?" T'ou Tzu said, "Swallowing three or four." Again
he asked, "How is it after the moon is full?" T'ou Tzu said,
"Spitting out seven or eight." When T'ou Tzu received people
he always used this ability.
When he answered this monk (in the main case) he just used
the one word "Right." This monk got hit both times. Hence
Hsueh Tou says, "The same for that and the same for this."
The first four lines have all at once completed Hsueh Tau's
praise of T'ou Tzu.
At the end Hsueh Tou versifies the monk saying, "How

When this monk had exhausted his clever maneuvers, as before
he died amidst T'ou Tzu's words, so T'ou Tzu then hit him.

Hsueh Tau releases this monk and says that if he suddenly
came to life and overturned the meditation seat, then even
T'ou Tzu would have to fall back three thousand miles, and
then "The hundred rivers would reverse their flow with a rush­

EIGHTIETH CASE

Chao Chou's Newborn Baby

CASE

A monk asked Chao Chou, "Does a newborn baby also have
the sixth consciousness? "1 Chao Chou said, "(Like) tossing a
ball on swift-flowing water."2
The monk also asked T'ou Tzu, "What is the meaning of
'Tossing a ball on swift-flowing water'? "3 T'ou Tzu said,
"Moment to moment, nonstop flow."4

NOTES

1.

With a lightning flash intellect, what newborn baby is he talking
about?

2.

It's gone by. Even a swift hawk cannot overtake it. You still must
check it out.

3.

This too is adepts investigating together. Understand? It's gone
by.

4.

He's a fellow who creates complications.

COMMENTARY

In the school of the Teachings, this eighth consciousness is set
up as the true basis. Mountains, rivers, and the great earth, sun,
moon, and stars come into being because of it. It comes as the
advance guard and leaves as the rearguard. The Ancients say
that "The triple world is only mind-the myriad things are
only consciousness." If one experiences the stage of Buddha­
hood, the eight consciousnesses are transformed into the four
wisdoms.a In the school of the Teachings they call this
"Changing names, not changing essence."
Sense-faculties, sense-objects, and consciousness of sensa­
tion are three. Originally we are unable to discriminate among
the sense-objects before us. But the subtle inner faculties can
produce consciousness, and consciousness can reveal dis437

438

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

crimination of forms. This is the sixth consciousness­
conceptual thinking. The seventh consciousness is Manas. It
can go take hold of the imaginary things of the world and cause
a person to be vexed and troubled so that he doesn't attain
freedom and independence. As for the eighth consciousness,
it's called the Alayavijnana and it's also called the Storehouse
Consciousness. It contains all the seeds of good and evil.
This monk knew the ideas of the verbal teachings, so he
used them to question Chao Chou by saying, "Does a newborn
baby also have the sixth consciousness or not?" Although a
newborn baby is equipped with the six consciousnesses,
though his eyes can see and his ears can hear, he doesn't yet
discriminate among the six sense-objects. At this time he
knows nothing of good and evil, long and short, right and
wrong, or gain and loss. A person who studies the Path must
become again like an infant. Then praise and blame, success
and fame, unfavorable circumstances and favorable environ­
ments-none of these can move him. "Though his eyes see
form, he is the same as a blind man; though his ears hear
sound, he is the same as a deaf man." He is like a fool, like an
idiot-his mind is motionless as Mt. Sumeru. This is the place
where patchrobed monks really and truly acquire power.
An Ancient said, "My patched garment covering my head,
myriad concerns cease: at this time I don't understand any­
thing at all." Only if you can be like this will you have a small
share of attainment. Though an adept is like this, nevertheless
he can't be fooled at all-as before, mountains are mountains
and rivers are rivers. He is without artifice and without cling­
ing thoughts. He is like the sun and moon moving through the
sky without ever stopping and without saying, "I have so many
names and forms." He is like the sky everywhere covering, like
the earth everywhere supporting: since they have no mind,
they bring up and nurture myriad beings without saying, "I
have so many accomplishments." Since sky and earth are
mindless, they last forever-what has mind has limits. A per­
son who has attained the Path is like this too. In the midst of
no activity, he carries out his activities, accepting all unfavor­
able and favorable circumstances with a compassionate heart.
When they got to this point the Ancients still upbraided
themselves and said, "When you've completely perfectly com­
prehended,

there's nothing to comprehend;

in the dark,

Eightieth Case

439

abstruse, hidden place, you still must be rebuked." They also
said, "All things are thoroughly comprehended and all beings
are clearly understood-when one who has Arrived senses this,
he's startled in the darkness." Again it was said, "Without
making a sound he goes beyond the ordinary and enters sage­
hood. The reclining dragon deeply fears the blue pool's clarity."
If human beings can be like this always, how can a single name
remain in the world? Though it's this way, they must go on to
leap out of their nest before they attain.
Haven't you seen where it says in the (Hua Yen) sutra,b "A
bodhisattva of the eighth stage, Immovability, turns the great
Dharma Wheel in an atom of dust, using the wisdom of non­
activity. At all times, whether walking, standing, sitting, or
lying down, he doesn't cling to gain and loss, but lets himself
move and flow into the sea of All-Knowledge." When patch­
robed monks get here they still must not become attached:
they follow the occasion freely. When they have tea, they drink
tea; when they have food, they eat food. Neither the words
"concentration" nor "not concentration" can be applied to this
transcendental matter.
Master Shan Tao of the Stone Grotto taught his congrega­
tion saying, "Haven't you seen a little one when it's just
emerged from the womb? Has a baby ever said, 'I know how to
read the scriptures'? At that time it does not know the meaning
of having the Buddha nature or not having the Buddha nature.
As he grows up he learns all sorts of knowledge; then he comes
forth saying 'I am able' and 'I understand,' without knowing
that this is troubling over illusory dusts. Among the sixteen
contemplation practices, the baby's practice is the best. When
he's babbling he symbolizes the person studying the Path, with
his detachment from the discriminating mind that grasps and
rejects. That's why I'm praising infants. I can make a compari­
son by taking the case of a baby, but if I say that the baby is the
Path, people of these times would misunderstand."
Nan Ch'uan said, "After eighteen, I was able to make a
living." Chao Chou said, "After eighteen, I was able to break
up the family and scatter the household." He also said, "I was
in the South for twenty years: only the two mealtimes of gruel
and rice were points of mixed application of mind."
Ts'ao Shan asked a monk,
In his concentration the
'"

bodhisattva smells the fragrant elephant crossing the river very

clearly.' What scripture does this come from?" The monk said,
"From the Nirvana scripture." Shan said, "Does he smell it
before or after his concentration?" The monk said "You've
flowed, Teacher." Shan said, "Receive it on the river bank."
Again: the Surangama scripture says, "The fullness (of the
six consciousnesses) enters to merge in the fullness (of the
Storehouse Consciousness), going into the realm of conscious­
ness."
Again: the Lankavatara scripture says, "Birth of signs­
being obstructed by grasping. Birth of conception-false think­
ing. Birth of flow-pursuing falsehood, revolving and flowing.
You must get out of the third aspect, 'birth of flow'; only then
will you be joyfully alive and independent."c
Thus Kuei Shan asked Yang Shan, "How is it with you Dis­
ciple Chi?" Yang Shan said, "Are you asking about his percep­
tive understanding or his active understanding? If you ask
about his active understanding, I don't know. If you ask about
his perceptive understanding, it's like a pitcher of water being
poured into a pitcher of water." If you can be like this you can
be the teacher of a region.
When Chao Chou said, "Tossing a ball on swift-flowing wa­
ter," he was already turning smoothly. When you toss it onto
swift-flowing water, in a blink of an eye it's gone. As the
Surangama scripture says, "Looked upon from afar, swift­
flowing water is tranquil and still." An Ancient said, "In a
fast-flowing river the currents of water never stop and they are
unaware of each other-all things are like this too." The mean­
ing of Chao Chou's answer is completely similar to these (quo­
tations).
The monk also asked T'ou Tzu, "What is the meaning of
'Tossing a ball on swift-flowing water'?" T'ou Tzu said, "Mo­
ment to moment, nonstop flow," spontaneously matching the
monk's question perfectly. The practice of these Ancients,
Chao Chou and T'ou Tzu, was so thoroughgoing that they
answered as one. They no longer make use of calculations-as
soon as you question them they already know where you come
down.
Although a baby's sixth consciousness is inactive, neverthe­
less from moment to moment it doesn't stop, but flows on like
a hidden river. Of T'ou Tzu's answering this way we can say
that he profoundly discerns oncoming winds.

Watch it and you'll go blind. It's gone. "Receive it on the

river bank."

COMMENTARY

"Sixth consciousness inactive-he puts forth a question."
When the Ancients studied the Path they brought themselves
to this point: this is called "achievement of non-activity."
They were the same as a newborn baby: though possessed of
eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, they didn't discrimi­
nate among the six sense-objects. In sum, they were non­
active. When you get to this realm, then you can overcome
dragons and subdue tigers, die sitting or die standing up. Right
now people should just take the myriad phenomena before
their eyes and put them to rest at once. What need is there to
get above the eighth stage (of a bodhisattva) before you can be
like this? Although there's no activity, as of old mountains are
mountains and rivers are rivers.
In a previous verse (about Chao Chou and T'ou Tzu, in Case

41) Hsueh Tou said,

"In living there's an eye-still, it's the

same as death/Why use anti-serum to test an adept?" Since
Chao Chou and T'ou Tzu were adepts he says, "The adepts

442

have both discerned where he's coming from-/On the bound­
less swift-flowing water, tossing a ball." T'ou Tzu said, "Mo­
ment to moment, nonstop flow." Do all of you people know
what this really means? At the end Hsueh Tau has people set
eyes on it for themselves and watch. Hence he says, "Where it
comes down, it doesn't stay-who can watch it?" This is
Hsueh Tau's living line. But say, what does it really mean?

The eight consciousnesses are transformed into four knowledges
as follows: The first five consciousnesses (associated with seeing,
hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching) are transmuted into the
Knowledge of Accomplishment. The sixth consciousness be­

Kuei Shan said to Yang Shan, "I consider the Mirror Knowledge to
be the source of the school. It produces three kinds of birth: birth
of conception, birth of signs, birth of flowings. The

Surangama

scripture says, 'Concepts and signs constitute the dusts; con­
scious feelings constitute defilement. Detach from both and your
Dharma Eye will be clear and pure at all times: how could you fail
then to realize unexcelled correct awakening?' The birth of con­
ception is fragmentation and confusion of the mind which thinks;
the birth of signs is the manifestation of the object thought of.
Together with the subtle flowings, they constitute the dusts and
defilements. If you can clear them completely, only then will you
be free."

COMMENTARY

In the Ts'ao Tung tradition this case is called "a question that
uses things." It's also called "a question testing the host," used
in order to illustrate his present state of mind.
Ordinarily deer and elk are easy to shoot. Only the elk of
elks, that is, the king among deer, is very difficult to shoot.
This (king) elk always sharpens his horns on the rocks of the
cliffs (where it lives,) so that they become sharp as sword
blades. He defends the herd of deer with his own body so that
even tigers cannot come near.
Likewise, this monk seems intelligent and alert as he draws
on this to question Yao Shan to reveal what he would do first.
Shan said, "Look-an arrow!" An expert Teaching Master, he
is undeniably marvellous, like sparks struck from stone, like a
flash of lightning.
Haven't you heard (about what happened) when San P'ing
first called on Shih Kung? As soon as Kung saw him coming, he
immediately went through the motion of bending a bow and
said, "Look-an arrow!" San P'ing opened his breast (to the
"arrow") and said, "This is the arrow that kills the man-what
is the arrow that brings the man life?" Kung plucked the bow­
string three times, whereupon San P'ing bowed in homage.
Kung said, "After thirty years with a single bow and two ar­
rows, today I've finally managed to shoot half a sage." Then he
broke his bow and arrows.
Later San P'ing took this up with Ta Tien. Tien said, "Since
it is the arrow that brings people life, why draw it on a bow­
string?" an P'ing was speechless. Tien said, "Thirty years
hence it will still be hard to find someone to raise these
words."
Fa Teng had a verse saying:

Eighty-first Case

445

In the old days we had Master Shih KungSetting his bow and arrows, he sat.
He went on like this for thirty years­
Not a single one understood (until)
San P'ing came and hit the target,
And father and son reached harmony.
Thinking back carefully, (I see that)
From the beginning, they were shooting the mound
(instead of the target on it.)

Shih Kung's strategy was the same as Yao Shan's. San P'ing
had an eye on his forehead, so he hit the target immediately
given a single phrase. It was just like Yao Shan saying,
"Look-an arrow!" and this monk then letting himself fall
down, playing the elk. This monk seemed to be an adept too,
but it's just that he had a head but no tail. Once he had set his
trap, he wanted to make Yao Shan fall in. But what could he
do? Yao Shan was an adept and kept on pressing relentlessly.
When Shan said, "Attendant, drag this dead fellow out," it was
as if he was extending his battle lines forward. This monk then
ran out: he may have been right, but nonetheless he wasn't free
and clean, his hands and feet were stuck. That's why Yao Shan
said, "This fellow playing with a mud ball-what end will
there be to it?" If Yao Shan hadn't had the final word at that
time, he would have been criticized by others down through
the ages.
Shan said, "Look-an arrow!" whereupon this monk fell
down. Tell me, was this understanding or not? If you say it was
understanding, why then did Yao Shan speak of him this way,
as a fellow playing with a mud ball? This was extremely evil,
just like (the following):
A monk asked Te Shan, "How is it when a student holding a
sharp sword tries to take the Master's head?" Te Shan extended
his neck forward toward him and shouted. The monk said,
"The Master's head has fallen." Te Shan lowered his head and
returned to his abbot's quarters. Again: Yen T'ou asked a
monk, "Where have you come from?" The monk said, "From
the Western Capital." Yen T'ou said, "After Huang Ch'ao
passed by, did you take his sword?" The monk said, "I did."
Yen T'ou extended his neck forward toward him and shouted.
The monk said, "The Master's head has fallen." Yen T'ou

446

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

laughed loudly. Cases of this kind are all traps to fell tigers, just
like the present main case. Fortunately Yao Shan wasn't taken
in by this monk-since he saw through him, he just kept on
pressing.
Hsueh Tou says, "Although this monk lived for three steps,
after five steps he had to die." Although this monk knew very
well how to look at the arrow, he immediately let himself fall
down-when Yao Shan said, "Attendant, drag this dead fellow
out," he immediately ran out. Hsueh Tou says, "I'm afraid he
won't live beyond three steps." If the monk had leaped beyond
five steps at that time, no one in the world would have been
able to handle him.
In a meeting of adepts, from beginning to end there must be
an uninterrupted interchange of guest and host; only then is
there a share of freedom and independence. Since at that time
the monk wasn't able to continue from beginning to end, con­
sequently he meets with Hsueh Tou's censure. But at the end
Hsueh Tou himself uses his words for his verse saying:

VERSE

The elk of elksSet your eyes high and look! He raises his head wearing
horns.
You should take a look.
What sort of thing is it? He's running in the secondary
level. If you want to shoot, then shoot, but why look?
(Yao Shan) releases one arrowOn target. You must realize that Yao Shan is an expert.
(The monk) runs three steps.
He's leaping with life, but only for three steps. He's been
dead a long time.
If he had lived for five steps,
What for? He leaps a hundred steps. How is it when unex­
pectedly finding life in the midst of death?
He would have formed a herd and chased the tiger.
The two reflect each other. You should fall back three
thousand miles. The world's patchrobed monks let the
tiger get away.

Eighty-first Case

447

The correct eye has always been given to a hunter.
What can you do? Yao Shan doesn't consent to acknowl­

edge these words. It's so for Yao Shan-what about Hsueh
Tau? It doesn't concern Yao Shan, it doesn't concern
Hsueh Tau, it doesn't concern me, and it doesn't concern
you.
In a loud voice Hsueh Tou said, "Look-an arrow!"

One punishment for all their crimes. You must fall back
three thousand miles from them before you're all right. I
hit, saying, "He's already blocked off your throats."

COMMENTARY

"The elk of elks-you should take a look." Patchrobed monks
must have the eye of the elk of elks and the horns of the elk of
elks, they must have devices and strategy. Even if it's a fierce
tiger with wings or a great cat with horns, the elk of elks can
still preserve his body and keep harm at a distance. At that
time when this monk let himself fall, he was saying of himself,
"I am the elk of elks."
"Yao Shan releases one arrow-the monk runs three steps."
When Yao Shan said, "Look-an arrow!" the monk then fell
down. When Yao Shan said, "Attendant, drag this dead fellow
out," the monk then ran out. He did very well, but neverthe­
less he was only able to run three steps.

"If he had lived for five steps,/He would have formed a herd
and chased the tiger." Hsueh Tou said, "I'm afraid that after
five steps he had to die. If he had been able to leap beyond five
steps at that time, then he would have been able to gather his
herd and gone to chase the tiger." The horns of the elk of elks
are sharp as spears-when a tiger sees him, even he becomes
afraid and flees. This elk is the king among the deer: he always
leads the herd in driving the tiger to another mountain.
Finally Hsueh Tou praises Yao Shan for having a way to
assert himself in that situation. "The correct eye had always
been given to a hunter." Yao Shan is like a hunter who knows
how to shoot and this monk is like (his quarry) the elk. Then,
having gone up to the hall and related this story, Hsueh Tou
wrapped it up into a single bundle, speaking a single line in a
loud voice: "Look-an arrow!" At once those who had been
sitting and standing (listening to him) were unable to stir.

Ta Lung's Hard and Fast Body of
Reality

POINTER

Only those with eyes can know the fishing line. Only adepts
can handle devices outside of patterns. But say, what is the
fishing line? What are devices beyond patterns? To test I'm
citing this old case: look!

CASE

A monk asked Ta Lung, "The physical body rots away: what is
the hard and fast body of reality? "1
Lung said, "The mountain flowers bloom like brocade, the
valley streams are brimming blue as indigo."2

NOTES

His statement makes them into two. Still, it's all right to separate
them.

end of the province, I go to the other end.

COMMENTARY

If you go to the words to search for this thing, it's like trying to
hit the moon by waving a stick-you won't make any connec­
tion. An Ancient clearly stated, "If you want to attain Inti­
macy, don't ask with questions. Why? Because the question is
in the answer and the answer is in the question."

449

450

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

This monk picked up a load of crudeness and exchanged it
for a load of confusion: in posing this question, his defeat was
not slight. How could anyone other than Ta Lung manage to
cover heaven and cover earth? The monk asking this way and
Ta Lung answering this way is a single whole. Ta Lung didn't
move a hair's breadth: it was like seeing a rabbit and releasing a
falcon, like seeing a hole and putting in a plug. Is this time and
season in the twelve-part canon of the Triple Vehicle? Undeni­
ably his answer was extraordinary, it's just that his words have
no flavor and he blocks up people's mouths. Thus it is said,
"When white clouds lie across the valley mouth, many birds
returning by night can't find their nests."
Some say that this was just answering glibly. Those who
understand in this fashion are nothing but exterminators of the
Buddha's race. They are far from knowing that with one device
and one objective, the Ancients broke fetters and smashed
chains, that every word and phrase were pure gold and raw
gems.
If one has the eye and brain of a patchrobed monk, some­
times he holds fast and sometimes he lets go. Shining and
functioning at the same time, with both persons and objects
taken away, both sides let go and both sides gather in. Facing
the situation, he changes accordingly. Without the great func­
tion and great capacity, how would he be able to enclose
heaven and earth like this? Much as a bright mirror on its
stand: when a foreigner comes, a foreigner appears, and when a
native comes, a native appears.
This case is the same as the story (case

39)

of the Flower

Hedge, though the meaning is not the same. Here the monk's
question was ignorant, so Ta Lung's answer was exactly appro­
priate. Haven't you heard (this story, case 27)? A monk asked
Yun Men, "How is it when the tree withers and the leaves
fall?" Men said, "The body exposed in the golden wind." This
is called "arrowpoints meeting." Here the monk asked Ta
Lung, "The physical body rots away: what is the hard and fast
body of reality?" Ta Lung said, "The mountain flowers bloom
like brocade, the valley streams are brimming blue as indigo."
This is just like "you go west to Ch'in, I go east to Lu": since he
acts this way, I don't act this way. Matching Ta Lung's answer
with Yun Men's, they're opposites. It's easy to see Yun Men

Eighty-second Case

451

acting thus, but it's hard to see Ta Lung acting otherwise.
Nevertheless, Ta Lung's tongue is very subtle.

VERSE

Asking without knowing.
East and west not distinguished. Playing with the thing
without knowing its name. He buys the hat to fit the
head.
Answering, still not understanding.
South and north not differentiated. He switched the
monk's skull around. South of the river, north of the river.
The moon is cold, the wind is highWhat is it like? Today is precisely this time and season.
The world's people have eyes but have never seen, have
ears but have never heard.
On the ancient cliff, frigid juniper.
Even better when it's not raining. A flute with no holes
hitting against a felt-pounding board.
How delightful: on the road he met a man who had attained
the Path,
You too must get here personally before you're all right.
Give me back my staff. They come like this, forming a
crowd.
And didn't use speech or silence to reply.
Where will you see Ta Lung? What would you use to
answer him properly?
His hand grasps the white fade whip.
It should be broken to pieces.
And smashes the black dragon's pearl. a
It remains for future people to look at. Too bad!
If he hadn't smashed it,
Letting his move go. Again you go on like this.
He would have increased its flaws.
What is he doing, playing with a mud ball? He seems
more and more decrepit. His crimes fill the sky.

452

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

The nation has a code of lawsThose who know the law fear it. "In the morning three
thousand blows, at night eight hundred blows."
Three thousand a rticles of offenses.
He's only told the half of it. There are eighty-four
thousand. Countless eons of uninterrupted hell wouldn't
make up for half of it.

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou versifies here with much skill. Before when he was
versifying Yun Men's words ("body exposed in the golden
wind") he said, "Since the question has the source/The answer
too is in the same place." Since it's not so with this case,
Hsueh Tou instead says, "Asking without knowing/
Answering, still not understanding." Ta Lung's answer was a
glimpse from the side that was simply amazing. His answer
was so clear that whoever questioned him this way had already
incurred defeat even before he asked. With his answer he was
able to bend down to the monk and match him perfectly:
adapting to his capacity he rightly said, "The mountain flowers
bloom like brocade, the valley streams are brimming blue as
indigo." How will all of you understand Ta Lung's meaning
right now? As a glimpse from the side, his answer was truly
extraordinary.
Thus Hsueh Tou comes out with his verse to make people
realize that the moon is cold, the wind is high and still beats
against the frigid juniper on the ancient cliff. But say, how will
you understand Hsueh Tau's meaning? Thus I just said that it's
a flute with no holes hitting against a felt-pounding board.
The verse is completed with just these first four lines, but
Hsueh Tou was still fearful that people would make up
rationalizations, so he said, "How delightful: on the road he
met a man who had attained the Path,/And didn't use speech or
silence to reply." This matter, then, is not seeing, hearing,
discernment, or knowledge; nor is it the discriminations of
calculating thought. Therefore it was said:
Direct and truthful, without bringing anything else
along,

Eighty-second Case

453

Moving on alone-what is the re to depend on!
On the road, if you meet anyone who has attained
the Path,
Don't use speech or silence to reply.

This is a verse of Hsiang Yen's that Hsueh Tou has drawn on.
Haven't you heard? A monk asked Chao Chou, "Without using
speech or silence to answer, I wonder with what should one
answer?" Chou said, "Show your lacquer vessel." These (say­
ings of Hsiang Yen and Chao Chou) are the same as Ta Lung's
statement (in the main case): they don't fall within the scope of
your feelings or conceptual thoughts.
What is this like? "His hand grasps the white jade whip/And
smashes the black dragon's pearl." Thus the command of the
patriarchs must be carried out, cutting off everything in the ten
directions. This is the matter on the sword's edge, for which
one must have this kind of strategy. Otherwise you tum your
back on all the sages since antiquity. When you get here you
must be without the slightest concern, then naturally you'll
have the advantage. This, then, is how a transcendent man
comports himself. "If he hadn't smashed it," necessarily "He
would have increased its flaws," and thus he would have
seemed broken down and decrepit.
But in the end, how can you be right? "The nation has a code
of laws-/Three thousand articles of offenses." There are three
thousand subdivisions of the five punishments, and none is
greater than (the punishment) for not being respectful. This
monk offended against all three thousand articles at once. How
so? Because he didn't deal with people on the basis of his own
thing. As for Ta Lung, he of course was not this way.

COMMENTARY

Great Master Yun Men produced more than eighty men of
knowledge. Seventeen years after he passed on, when they
opened his tomb and beheld him, (his body was not decom­
posed, but) upright and sound as formerly. The field of his
vision had been bright and clear, his mentality and perspective
swift. All his instructions, alternative remarks, and words spo­
ken on behalf of others were direct, solitary, and steep. This
present case is like sparks struck from stone, like flashing
lightning; in fact, it's "a spirit appearing and a demon disap­
pearing."a Librarian Ch'ing said, "Is there such talk in the
whole great treasury of the Teachings?"

454

Eighty-third Case

455

Peo ple these days make their living on emotional interpreta­
tions and say "Buddha is the guide for the three realms, the
compassionate father of the four orders of living beings. Why
then do the ancient Buddhas merge with the pillar?" If you
understand this way, you'll never be able to find it. Some call
(Yun Men's saying) "calling out from within nothingness."
They are far from knowing that the talk of the teaching mas­
ters of our school cuts off conceptual consciousness, cuts off
emotional evaluation, cuts off birth and death, and cuts off the
defilement of doctrine, enters the correct stateb without retain­
ing anything at all. As soon as you rationalize and calculate,
you tie your hands and feet.
But tell me, what was old Yun Men's meaning? Just make
mind and objects a single thusness; then good and bad, right
and wrong, won't be able to shake you. Then it will be all right
whether you say "there is" or "there isn't"; then it will be all
right whether you have mental activity or you don't. When you
get here, each and every clap of the hands is the true impera­
tive. My late teacher Wu Tsu said, "Yun Men, supposedly so
great, really didn't have much guts." If it were me, I just would
have told him, "The eighth level of mental activity."
He said, "The ancient Buddhas and the pillar merge-what
level of mental activity is this?" In that moment he wrapped it
all up in front of you. When a monk asked him what this
meant, Yun Men said, "one belt worth thirty cents." He has
the eye to judge heaven and earth.
Since no one understood, afterwards he himself spoke on
their behalf: "On South Mountain clouds gather, on North
Mountain rain falls." Thus he opened up a route of entry for
future students. That's why Hsueh Tou picks out the place
where he settles heaven and earth to make people see. But as
soon as you blunder into calculation, you stumble past and
miss it, though it's right in front of you. You simply must go to
the source of Yun Men's fundamental meaning to clearly un­
derstand his lofty mind. Thus the verse says,
VERSE

South Mountain clouds,

Throughout heaven and earth, they can't be seen. A knife

cannot cut in.

look. Uh-oh! What a pity! But say, is it the ancient Bud­
dhas or the pillar?

COMMENTARY

"South Mountain clouds, I North Mountain rain." Hsueh Tou
buys the hat to fit the head, watches the wind to set his sails.
On the edge of a sword, he puts down footnotes for you. As for
"The Twenty-eight (Indian Ch'an Patriarchs) and Six (Chinese
Ch'an Patriarchs) see it before them," don't misunderstand!
This simply versifies "The ancient Buddhas and the pillar
merge-what level of mental activity is this?"
Afterwards, Hsueh Tou opens up a road and creates compli­
cations to make you see Yun Men's meaning. "In Korea they've
gone up into the hall, I In China they haven't yet beaten the
drum." Hsueh Tou goes where the thunder rolls and comets fly
and says, "In suffering, happiness- I In happiness, suffering."

wrote,

In early Buddhism, the "correct state" means nirvana, the extinc­
tion of egoism and suffering. In the Ts'ao-Tung Ch'an tradition,
the "correct state" was used to refer to emptiness as opposed
(propositionally in dialectic and subjectively in meditation) to the
"biased state," or the realm of myriad forms. The patriarchs of the
Ts'ao-Tung school used a five step dialectic to show that the
correct and biased simultaneously contain each other, and that
each (defined as separate under the aforementioned conditions)
has both a correct and biased, or absolute and relative, aspect. Of
the correct, or absolute, Ts'ao Shan said, "This correct state does
not come from illumination; it is so whether or not the Buddhas
appear in the world. Thus all the thousand sages, the myriad
sages, return to the correct state to attain realization" (from Wu I
Hsien Chueh, "Revealing the Secret of the Five Ranks").

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

ChangEr and Ch'en Yu are the proverbial close friends who fell
out and turned against each other. During the period of the fall of
the Ch'in dynasty (end of the third century B.C.) Ch'en Yu's
father had occupied territory with his army and begun to revive
an independent state of Chao. (China had been unified for the first
time under the Ch'in dynasty, which had conquered the six other
major states, one of which was Chao.) ChangEr was an important
minister in Chao under the Ch'ens. Later the friendship between
ChangEr and Ch'en Yu turned to hatred, and Chang Er cooper­
ated with the forces of one of the generals of the founder of the
Han dynasty (which eventually succeeded Ch'in), which de­
stroyed independent Chao and killed Ch'en Yu.

EIGHTY-FOURTH CASE

Vimalakirti's Gate of Nonduality

POINTER

Though you say "It is," there is nothing which "is" can affirm.
Though you say "It is not," there is nothing that "is not" can
negate. When "is" and "is not" are left behind, and gain and
loss are forgotten, then you are clean and naked, free and at
ease.
But tell me, what is in front of you and in back of you? If
there is a patchrobed monk who comes forward and says, "In
front is the Buddha shrine and the mdn gate, behind is the
abbot's sleeping room and private quarters," tell me, does this
man have eyes or not? If you can judge this man, I'll allow that
you have personally seen the Ancients.

CASE

Vimalakirti asked Manjusri, 1 "What is a bodhisattva's entry
into the Dharma gate of nonduality? "2
Manjusri said, "According to what I think,3 in all things,4 no
words, no speech,5 no demonstration and no recognition,6 to
leave behind all questions and answers; 7 this is entering the
Dharma gate of nonduality."8
Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti, "We have each already
spoken. Now you should tell us, good man, what is a
bodhisattva's entry into the Dharma gate of nonduality? "9
Hsueh Tau said, "What did Vimalakirti say?"10 He also said,
"Completely exposed."1'

NOTES
1. This fellow is making quite a fuss. He should shut his mouth.

stocks, carrying evidence of his crime, hauling himself into the
magistrate's office.
4. What is he calling "all things"?
5. What is he saying?
6. He can fool others ...
7. What is he saying?
8. What's the use of entering? What's the use of so many complica­

tions?
9. Not even the Buddhas of the past, present, and future, let alone

the Golden Grain Tathagata (Vimalakirti), can open their mouths
about this one support. Manjusri has turned the spear around and
stabbed one man to death. The arrow hits Vimalakirti just as he
was shooting at the others.
10. Bah! Hsueh Tou gathers ten thousand arrows to his breast and

speaks the truth in Vimalakirti's place.
11. Not only that time, but now too, it is so. Hsueh Tou is drawing

his bow after the thief has gone. Although he uses all his strength
to help the congregation, what can he do-calamity comes forth
from his own door. But tell me, can Hsueh Tou see where this
comes down? Since he hasn't seen it even in a dream, how can he
say "completely exposed"? Danger! Even the golden-haired lion is
unable to search it out.

COMMENTARY

Vimalakirti had the various great bodhisattvas each speak on
the Dharma gate of nonduality. At the time, the thirty-two
bodhisattvas all took dualistic views of doing and nondoing, of
the two truths, real and conventional, and merged them into a
monistic view which they considered to be the Dharma gate of
nonduality.
Finally he asked Manjusri. Manjusri said, "According to
what I think, in all things, no words and no speech, no demon­
stration and no recognition, to leave behind all questions and
answers; this is entering the Dharma gate of nonduality."
Since the other thirty-two had used words to dispense with
words, Manjusri used no-words to dispense with words. At
once he swept everything away, not wanting anything, and

Eighty-fourth Case

461

considered this to be the Dharma gate of nonduality. He cer­
tainly didn't realize that this was the sacred tortoise dragging
its tail, that in wiping away the tracks he was making traces.
It's just like a broom sweeping away dust; though the dust is
removed, the tracks of the broom still remain.
Since in the end, as before, some traces were left, Manjusri
then asked Vimalakirti, "We have each already spoken. Now
you tell us, good man, what is a bodhisattva's entry into the
Dharma gate of nonduality?" Vimalakirti was silent. If you're
alive, you'll never go sink into the dead water. If you make up
such (dead) views, you're like a mad dog chasing a clod of
earth.a
Hsueh Tou didn't say that Vimalakirti kept silent, nor did
he say that he sat silently on his seat. Hsueh Tou just went to
the critical point and said, "What did Vimalakirti say?" Just
when Hsueh Tou spoke this way, did he see Vimalakirti? He
hadn't seen him even in a dream.
Vimalakirti was an ancient Buddha of the past, who also had
a family and household. He helped the Buddha Shakyamuni
teach and transform. He had inconceivable intelligence, incon­
ceivable perspective, inconceivable supernatural powers and
the wondrous use of them. Inside his own room he accommo­
dated thirty-two thousand jeweled lion thrones and a great
multitude of eighty thousand, without it being too spacious or
too crowded. But tell me, what principle is this? Can it be
called the wondrous function of supernatural powers? Don't
misunderstand; if it is the Dharma gate of nonduality, only by
attaining together and witnessing together can there be com­
mon mutual realization and knowledge.
Only Manjusri was able to give a reply. Even so, was he able
to avoid Hsueh Tau's censure? Hsueh Tou, talking as he did,
also had to meet with these two men (Vimalakirti and Man­
jusri). Hsueh Tau said, "What did Vimalakirti say?" and
"Completely exposed." You tell me, where was the exposure?
This little bit has nothing to do with gain or loss, nor does it
fall into right and wrong. It's like being up on a ten thousand

COMMENTARY

Hsueh Tou says "Bah! to old Vimalakirti!" Why does he start
off at the very beginning reviling him? Right at the start Hsueh
Tou takes the Diamond King's jewel sword and cuts him right
off. Vimalakirti must be given three thousand blows in the
morning and eight hundred blows in the evening.

In Sanskrit, Vimalakirti means "undefiled repute" or "pure
name." He was also known as the Golden Grain Tathagata.
Haven't you heard how a monk asked Master Chien of Yun
Chu, "If he was the Golden Grain Tathagata, why then did he
listen to the Dharma in the congregation of the Tathagata
Shakyamuni?" Chien said, "He didn't contend over self and
others. Someone who is greatly liberated has nothing to do
with 'becoming Buddha' or 'not becoming Buddha.' If you say
that he practices cultivation and strives to attain the Path of
Buddhahood, this has even less to do with it." As the Perfect
Enlightenment Scripture says, "If you use your routine mind to
produce routine views, you will never be able to enter the
Tathagata's great ocean of peaceful extinction."
Yung Chia said, "Whether he's right or wrong, people can­
not know. Whether he goes against or goes along, the gods
cannot fathom. If he goes along, then he turns toward the stage
of the fruition of Buddhahood; if he goes against, then he enters
the realms of sentient beings." Meditation Master Shou said,
"Even if you can perfect yourself and get to this realm, you still
can't follow your inclinations. Only when you have experi­
enced the holy state without leaks can you go along or go
against." Thus Hsueh Tou said, "Out of compassion for living
beings, he suffers empty affliction." In the scripture Vim­
alakirti says, "Since sentient beings have illnesses, I also will
have an illness." Hsueh Tou says, "Lying ill in Vaisali," be­
cause Vimalakirti manifested his illness in the city of Vaisali.
"His whole body withered and emaciated." Vimalakirti used
his physical illness to preach the Dharma widely. He said,
"This body has no permanence, no strength, no power or so­
lidity; it's a thing that quickly decays, it can't be trusted. It
produces suffering and trouble, a mass of diseases. It is some­
thing made of the heaps, elements, and sense media com­
pounded together."

464

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

"The teacher of seven Buddhas comes." Manjusri was the
teacher of seven Buddhas, but he obeyed the World Honored
One's command to go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness.
"To the single room that's been swept repeatedly." Vimalakirti
had cleared everything out of his room, just leaving his bench.
When Manjusri arrived, he asked about the Dharma gate of
nonduality, so Hsueh Tau says, "He asks about the gate of
nonduali ty."
"Then Vimalakirti leans and falls." Vimalakirti's mouth
was bent into a frown. Followers of Ch'an these days say that
his speechlessness was the leaning and falling. But don't mis­
takenly go by the zero point of the scale.
Pushing you up onto a ten thousand fathom cliff, Hsueh Tau
then says, "He doesn't lean and fall." With one hand he lifts up,
with one hand he pushes down. Hsueh Tau has this kind of
skill, and the way he uses it is shalJl and clear. This line ver­
sifies his own previous comment, "What did Vimalakirti say?"
"The golden-haired lion has no place to look." It was not
only this way at that time, but it's this way right now. Do you
see old Vimalakirti? Even if the whole world, the mountains,
rivers, grasses, trees, and forests all turned into a golden-haired
lion (for you to ride, as does Manjusri), you still wouldn't be
able to find him.

The image of a dog which, hit with a clod of dirt thrown by a man,
ignores the man and chases the clod in anger, is found in the

Kasyapa-parivarta (the old Maharatnakuta scripture)i it sym­
bolizes those who are afraid of the delights of the senses and seek
deliverance in solitude and quiet-they never really become free
because they are dependent on solitude and quiet, becoming every
bit as much, and even more, miserable and confused as before
when they again come in contact with the hustle and bustle of
ordinary life.

Vimalakirti's show of disease is the setting of the Vimalakir­

shattered their views, demolishing the dualistic (samsara vs. nir­

vana) standpoint of Hinayana (Lesser Vehicle) Buddhism (which
is also symbolized by the 'dog chasing a clod' image of asceticism
noted above). So after the disciples begged off, Shakyamuni then
sent a host of bodhisattvas led by Manjusri to inquire after Vim­
alakirti; the latter took this opportunity to edify the bodhisattvas,
and the discussion of nonduality, as well as miraculous displays
and profound teachings by Vimalakirti, ensued.

EIGHTY-FIFTH CASE

The Hermit of T'ung Feng Makes

a

Tiger's Roar

POINTER

To hold the world fast without the slightest leak, so that all the
people in the world lose their points and become tongue­
tied-this is the true imperative for patchrobed monks.
To release a light from one's forehead that shines through
the four quarters-this is the adamantine eye of patchrobed
monks.
To touch iron and turn it into gold, to touch gold and turn it
into iron, to suddenly capture and suddenly release-this is the
staff of patchrobed monks.
To cut off the tongues of everyone in the world so that
there's no place for them to breathe out, to make them fall
back three thousand miles-this is the mettle of patchrobed
monks.
But tell me, when one is not this way at all, who is he? To
test I cite this to see.

COMMENTARY

TheTa Hsiung lineage (of Pai Chang Huai Hai) produced four
hermits: Ta MeV Pai Yun, Hu Ch'i, and T'ung Feng.
Look at how those two men had such knowing eyes and
capable hands. Tell me, where is the place that's difficult to
understand? Though produced to meet the situation, the An­
cients' one device, one object, one word, one phrase, are natu­
rally leaping with life, since their eyes are perspicacious and
true. Hsueh Tou picked this case to make people know wrong
from right and discern gain and loss. Nevertheless, from his
standpoint as a man who has arrived, though it's handled in
terms of gain and loss, after all there is no gain or loss. If you
view those Ancients in terms of gain and loss, you miss the
point entirely. People of the present day must each com­
prehend the place where there's no gain or loss. If you only
apply your mind to picking and choosing among words and
phrases, when will you ever be done?
Haven't you heard how Great Master Yun Men said, "Foot­
travellers, don't just wander over the country idly, just wanting
to pick up and hold onto idle words. As soon as some old
teacher's mouth moves, you immediately ask about Ch'an and

468

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

ask about Tao, ask about transcendance and accommodation,
ask about how and what. You make great volumes of commen­
taries which you stuff into your bellies, pondering and calculat­
ing. Wherever you go you put your heads together by the stove
in threes and fives, babbling on and on. These, you say, are
words of eloquence; these, words in reference to the self; these,
words in reference to things; these, words from within the
essence. You try to comprehend the old fathers and mothers of
your house. Once you have gobbled down your meal, you only
speak of dreams and say, 'I have understood the Buddha
Dharma.' You should know that if you go foot-travelling this
way, you will never be done."
When the Ancients briefly picked it up and played with it,
how could there be such views as victory and defeat, gain and
loss, or right and wrong?
T'ung Feng had seen Lin Chi. At the time of the story he had
built a hut deep in the mountains. This monk came there and
asked, "If you suddenly encountered a tiger here, what then?"
Feng then made a tiger's roar; he rightly went to the thing to
act. This monk too knew how to meet error with error, so he
made a gesture of fright. When the hermit laughed aloud, the
monk said, "You old thief! Feng said, "What can you do about
me? This is all right, but neither of them understood. From
ancient times on down, they've met with other people's criti­
cism. Thus Hsueh Tau said, "This is all right, but these two
11

11

wicked thieves only knew how to cover their ears to steal the
bell." Though both of them were thieves, nevertheless they
didn't take the opportunity to act; hence, they were covering
their own ears to steal the bell. With these two Elders, it's as
though they set up battle lines of a million troops, but only
struggled over the broom (for sweeping up casualties).
To discuss this matter, it is necessary to have the ability to
kill people without blinking an eye. If you always let go and
never capture, if you always kill and never bring to life, you
won't avoid the scornful laughter of others. Although this is so,
these Ancients still didn't have so many concerns. Observe
how they both saw their opportunity and acted. Wu Tsu spoke
of the concentration of supernatural powers at play, the con­
centration of the torch of wisdom, and the concentration of the
King of Adornment. It's just that people of later times don't
have their feet on the ground; they just go criticize the An-

Eighty-fifth Case

469

cients and say there is gain and loss. Some say that the hermit
clearly lost the advantage, but this has nothing to do with it.
Hsueh Tou said, "When these two men met, it was all let­
ting go." When the monk said, "If you suddenly encountered a
tiger here, then what?" and Feng made a tiger's roar, this was
letting go. And when he said, "What can you do about me?"
this too was letting go. In every instance they fell into the
secondary level of activity. Hsueh Tou said, "If you want to
act, then act." People these days hear such talk and say that at
the time the hermit should have carried out the imperative for
the monk. But you shouldn't blindly punish and beat the her­
mit.
As for Te Shan immediately hitting people when they came
in through the gate, and Lin Chi immediately shouting at
people when they came in through the gate-tell me, what was
the intent of these Ancients? In the end Hsueh Tou makes his
verse just like this. But tell me, in the end, how will you avoid
"covering your own ears to steal the bell"?
VERSE

"Why didn't you say, 'You old thief!'?"

COMMENTARY

"If you don't grab it when you see it, I You'll think about it a

thousand miles away." Just at the point of danger, the monk
couldn't use it at all; when the hermit said, "What can you do
about me?" the monk should have given him some of his own
provisions. If at that time he had been able to show his skill,
the hermit would have had to have a last word. Both men only
knew how to let go; they couldn't gather in. "If you don't grab
it when you see it" is already white clouds for ten thousand
miles; why did he go on to say, "You'll think about it a
thousand miles away"?
"Fine stripes- I But he hasn't got claws and teeth." This is
so, but a tiger also knows how to conceal his teeth and hide his
claws. What could he do, though-he didn't know how to bite
people.
"Haven't you seen the sudden encounter on Mt. Ta Hsiung?
I The vast sound and light shakes the earth." One day Pai

Chang asked Huang Po, "Where are you coming from?" Po
said, "From down the mountain." Chang said, "See any ti­
gers?" Po then made a tiger's roar. Chang took the axe at his
side and made the gesture of chopping. Po held it fast and
slapped him. That evening Chang went up into the hall and
said, "Down Ta Hsiung Mountain there's a tiger; all of you
must watch out for him when you're going and coming. Today
I myself have been bitten by him."
Later Kuei Shan asked Yang Shan, "What about Huang Po's
tiger story?" Yang said, "What is your esteemed opinion,

Eighty-fifth

471

Teacher?" Kuei Shan said, "At the time Pai Chang should have
chopped him to death with one blow; how did it come to this?"
Yang Shan said, "Not so." Kuei Shan said, "What about it
then?" Yang Shan said, "Not only did he ride the tiger's head,
but he also knew how to take the tiger's tail." Kuei Shan said,
"You do indeed have some precipitous phrases, Chi." Hsueh
Tou draws on this to illumine the main case.
"The vast sound and li gh t shakes the earth." This bit trans­
forms freely. Hsueh Tou wants to have a road to show himself
within the words. "Do great men of power see or not?" Do you
see? "They take the tiger's tail and grab the tiger's whiskers."
Here again this must be one's own. Even if you take the tiger's
tail and grab the tiger's whiskers, you won't avoid me instantly
piercing your nostrils.

Ta Hsiung was the name of the mountain on which Ch'an Master
Pai Chang Huai Hai lived and taught in the eighth and ninth
centuries A.D. It was known as Pai Chang because of its precipi­

name, according to custom. Ta Mei was actually an early succes­

Feng was a successor of Lin Chi, who succeeded to Huang Po, Pai
Chang's great disciple. Four of Lin Chi's successors were hermits.

has a beam of light shining continuously, now as of old, far
removed from seeing or knowing. Though it's a light, when
you're asked about it you don't understand-isn't it dark and
dim?" For twenty years he handed down this lesson, but there
was never anyone who understood his meaning.
Later Hsiang Lin asked Yun Men to speak on their behalf.
Men said, "The kitchen pantry and the main gate." He also
said, "A good thing isn't as good as nothing." Usually what he
said in place of others was just a single sentence; why then are
there two here? The first sentence barely opens a road for you
to let you see. If you're for real, as soon as you hear it men­
tioned, you get right up and go. Yun Men feared people would
get stuck here, so he also said, "A good thing is not as good as
nothing." As before, he's swept it away for you.
As soon as they hear you mention "light," people these days
immediately put a glare in their eyes and say, "Where is the
kitchen pantry? Where is the main gate?" But this has nothing
to do with it. Thus it is said, "Perceive the meaning on the
hook; don't abide by the zero point of the scale." This matter is
not in the eye or in the environment. To begin to understand
you must cut off knowing and seeing, forget gain and loss, and
become purified, naked, and perfectly at ease; each and every
one must investigate on his own.
Yun Men said, "You come and go by daylight; you distin­
guish people by daylight. Suddenly it's midnight, and there's
no sun, moon, or lamplight. If it's some place you've been to,
then of course it's possible; in a place you have never been, can
you even manage to get hold of something?"
(Shih T'ou's) Merging of Difference and Sameness says,
Right within light there's darkness,
But don't see it as darkness:
Right within darkness there's light,
But don't meet it as light.
If you cut off light and darkness, tell me, what is it? Thus it is
said, "The mind flower emits light, shining on all the lands in
the ten directions." P'an Shan said, "Light isn't shining on
objects, nor do the objects exist. Light and objects both forgot­
ten, then what is this?" Also it was said,

Just understand Yun Men's final statement thoroughly, then
you can go back to the former one to roam at play. But ulti­
mately, you do not make a living there. The ancient Vim­
alakirti said, "All things are established on a non-abiding
basis." You mustn't go here to play with lights and shadows
and give play to your spirit. Nor will it do to make up an
understanding in terms of nothingness. An Ancient said, "Bet­
ter you should give rise to a view of existence as big as Mt.
Sumeru, than that you produce a view of nothingness as small
as a mustard seed." People of the (lesser) two vehicles3 often
fall onesidedly into this view.

COMMENTARY

"Spontaneously shining, ranged in the solitary light." Origi­
nally, right where you stand, there's this beam of lighti it's just
that your use of it is dark. That's why Great Master Yun Men
set out this light for you right in front of your faces. But say,
what is everyone's light? "The kitchen pantry and the main
gate." This is where Yun Men arrays the solitary light. P'an
Shan said, "The mind-moon is solitary and fulli its light en­
gulfs myriad forms." This is the true, eternal, unique revela­
tion.
Afterwards "He opens a route for you." Yun Men still feared
that people would become attached to "The kitchen pantry,
the main gate." Conceding for the moment the kitchen pantry,
when the morning flowers fall and the tree has no shadow,
when the sun has gore down and the moon goes dark and all of
heaven and earth is black vastness-do you still see? "When
looking, who doesn't see?" Tell me, who is it that doesn't see?
Here, where "right within light there's darkness" and "right
within darkness there's light," both are "like a step forward
and a step backward." You must see for yourself.
Hsueh Tou says, "Seeing or not seeing," or versifies "A good
thing isn't as good as nothing." Merged with seeing, still you
don't seei merged with illumination, still you don't under­
stand.

The two vehicles refer to Buddhist disciples and self-enlightened
sages, who strive only for the extinction of passion and personal
suffering; they only realize the emptiness of ego and do not realize
the emptiness of things as identical to the things themselves.
They are apt to fall into the empty quiescence of subjective noth­
ingness, intoxicated by trance. Bodhisattvas, however, realizing
that existence itself is empty and not made so by annihilation, do
not fear life or seek death, and arouse great kindness and compas­
sion towards living beings, resolving that they all be liberated. If
one clings to the idea of nothingness, this compassion is impossi­
ble.

Medicine and Disease Subdue Each
Other

POINTER

A clear-eyed fellow has no nest: sometimes on the summit of

the solitary peak weeds grow in profusion; sometimes he's
naked and free in the bustling marketplace. Suddenly he ap­
pears as an angry titan with three heads and six arms; suddenly
as Sun Face or Moon Face Buddha he releases the light of all­
embracing mercy. In a single atom he manifests all physical
forms; to save people according to their type, he mixes with
mud and water. If suddenly he releases an opening upwards,
not even the Buddha's eye could see him; even if a thousand
sages appeared, they too would have to fall back three thousand
miles. Is there anyone with the same attainment and same

a way to get out? Twenty-four hours a day, concentrate on
"towering like a mile-high wall." Te Shan's blows fall like rain,
Lin Chi's shouts roll like thunder-putting this aside for the
moment, Shakymuni is himself Shakyamuni and Maitreya is
himself Maitreya. Those who don't know what it comes down
to frequently understand by calling it "medicine and disease
merging with each other." For forty-nine years, in more than
three hundred assemblies, the World Honored One adapted to
potential to set up the teachings-all of this was giving
medicine in accordance with the disease, like exchanging
sweet fruit for bitter gourds. Having purified your active facul­
ties, he made you clean and free.
"The whole earth is medicine." Where will you sink your
teeth into this? If you can sink your teeth in, I'll grant that you
have a place to turn around and show some life; then you see
Yun Men in person. If you look around and hesitate, you won't
be able to get your teeth into it; Yun Men is the one under your
feet.
"Medicine and disease subdue each other." This is just an
ordinary proposition. If you cling to existence, he speaks of
nonexistence for you; if you are attached to nonexistence, he
speaks of existence for you. If you are attached to neither exis­
tence nor nonexistence, he manifests the sixteen-foot golden
body for you in a pile of crap and rubbish, appearing and disap­
pearing.
Right now this whole great earth is a profuse array of myriad
forms, up to and including one's own self. At once it's
medicine-at such a time, what will you call your self? If you
only call it medicine, even by the time Maitreya Buddha is
born down here, you still won't have seen Yun Men even in
dreams. Ultimately, how is it? "Perceive the meaning on the
hook; don't stick by the zero point of the scale."
One day Manjusri ordered Sudhana to pick medicinal herbs.
He said, "If there is something that is not medicine, bring it to
me." Sudhana searched all over, but there was nothing that
was not medicine. So he went back and told Manjusri, "There
is nothing that is not medicine." Manjusri said, "Gather some­
thing that is medicine." Sudhana then picked up a blade of
grass and handed it to Manjusri. Manjusri held it up and
showed it to the assembly, saying, "This medicine can kill
people and it can also bring people to life."

This talk of medicine and disease subduing each other is
extremely difficult to see. Yun Men often used it in his room to
guide people. One day Elder Chin 0 called on Hsueh Tou. Chin
0 was an adept, an honorable worthy of the Yun Men succes­
sion. They discussed this statement "medicine and disease
subdue each other" all night until dawn before they were fi­

nally able to exhaust its excellence. At this point no learned
interpretations, thought or judgment can be employed. After­
wards, Hsueh Tou made a verse to see him off which said,
Medicine and disease subdue each other-most dif­
ficult to see;
The ten thousand locked gates indeed have no start­
ing point.
Wayfarer Chin 0 came calling;
In one night we exhausted the waves of the ocean of
learning.

Hsueh Tou's subsequent verse is most effective. Is his meaning
in the host or in the guest? You must see for yourself.
VERSE

The whole earth is medicine:

Who would you have discern the point? Scattering sand
and dirt. Put it on a high shelf.
Why have Ancients and moderns been so mistaken�

There's an echo in the words. With one brush stroke
they're all blotted out.
I don't make the carriage behind closed doors-

Great Hsueh Tou uses all his strength to help the assem­
bly, but misfortune comes forth from his own door. In the
calm vastness, not a hair is hanging. Who has any spare
time? He is making a living in a ghost cave.
The road through is naturally quiet and empty.

Set foot on it and you enter the weeds. When you get on
the horse, you'll see the road. He picks it up freely, unde­
niably outstanding.
Wrong! Wrong!
Twin swords fly through space. A single arrow fells two
eagles.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Though they be high as the sky, your nostrils have still been
pierced.

Your head has fallen. I hit, saying, "They've been
pierced!"

COMMENTARY

"The whole earth is medicine: I Why have Ancients and mod­
ems been so mistaken?" From ancient times till now those of
you who have understood by calling it medicine have instantly
gone wrong. Hsueh Tou said, "There's a kind of person who
doesn't know how to cut off Ta Mei's footsteps, but merely
says that (Ta Mei) was in too much of a hurry to go."a Hsueh
Tou knew how to cut off Yun Men's footsteps.
Since this one line of his had thrown everyone in the world
into confusion, Yun Men said, "When my staff is waves, you
may go freely in all directions; when the whole earth is waves,
I'll watch to see if you float or sink."
"I don't make the carriage behind closed doors-/The road
through is naturally quiet and empty." Hsueh Tou speaks to
open up a road for you: "If you build your carriage behind
closed doors, and you bring it out the gate and it fits the ruts,
what has this accomplished? I am not building the carriage
behind closed doors here. When I go out the door, naturally it's
quiet and empty." Here Hsueh Tou reveals a slight crack to let
people see.
Still hurrying on, Hsueh Tou then says, "Wrong! Wrong!"
Both Yun Men's former statement and his latter statement are
wrong. Who would know that Hsueh Tou's opening up a road
is also wrong? Since your nostrils are as high as the sky, why do
they get pierced anyway? Do you want to understand? Then
immerse yourself in this for thirty years. If you have a staff, I'll
give you a staff; if you have no staff, you won't avoid having
your nostrils pierced by others.

Hsuan Sha's Guiding and Aiding
Living Beings

POINTER

The established methods of our school are thus: they break two
into three. For profound talk entering into principle, you too
must be piercing and penetrating.
Taking charge of the situation, he hits home and smashes to
pieces the golden chainsa and the hidden barrier. He acts ac­
cording to the imperative, so that he obliterates all tracks and
traces.
Tell me, where is there confusion? For those who have the
eye on their forehead, I bring this up to see.

CASE

Hsuan Sha, teaching the community, said, "The old adepts
everywhere all speak of guiding and aiding living beings.1 Sup­
posing they encountered three kinds of sick person, how would
they guide them?2 With a blind person, they could pick up the
gavel or raise the whisk, but he wouldn't see.3 With a deaf
person, he wouldn't hear the point of words.4 With a mute
person, if they had him speak, he wouldn't be able to speak.5
But how would they guide such people? If they couldn't guide
these people, then the Buddha Dharma has no effect."6
A monk asked Yun Men for instruction on this.7 Yun Men
said, "Bow."8 The monk bowed and rose.9 Yun Men poked at
him with his staff; the monk drew back. Yun Men said,
"You're not blind."10 Then Yun Men called him closer; when
the monk approached,11 Men said, "You're not dea£."12 Next
Yun Men said, "Do you understand? "13 The monk said, "I
don't understand."14 Yun Men said, "You're not mute."15 At
this the monk had an insight.16

COMMENTARY

Hsuan Sha had investigated till he reached the point of
eliminating all emotional defilement and conceptual thought,
where he became purified and naked, free and unfettered; only
thus could he speak this way. At this time, when (Ch'an
flourished) and the various monasteries all looked to one an­
other, Hsuan Sha would often teach his community by saying,
"The old adepts, all over, all speak of guiding and aiding living

484

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

beings. If they should encounter three kinds of sick person,
how would they guide them? With a blind person, they could
pick up the gavel or raise the whisk, but he wouldn't see. With
a deaf person, he wouldn't hear the point of words. With a mute
person, if they had him speak, he wouldn't be able to speak. So
how would they teach such people? If they couldn't guide these
people, then the Buddha Dharma has no effect." If you people
right now understand this as being blind, deaf, and mute, you'll
never be able to find it. Thus it is said, "Don't die in the
words." To attain, you must understand Hsuan Sha's meaning.
Hsuan Sha often used this statement to guide people. There
was a monk who had been with Hsuan Sha for a long time. One
day, when Hsuan Sha went up into the hall, this monk asked,
"Will you permit me to present a theory of the story of the
three kinds of sick person, Teacher?" Hsuan Sha said, "Go
ahead." The monk then bade farewell and left. Sha said,
"Wrong! That's not it." Did this monk understand Hsuan Sha's
meaning? Fa Yen subsequently said, "When I heard Master Ti
Tsang tell about this monk I finally understood the story of the
three kinds of sick person." If you say this monk didn't under­
stand, then why would Fa Yen talk like this? If you say he did
understand, then why did Hsuan Sha say "wrong"?
One day Ti Tsang said to Hsuan Sha, "Teacher, I hear you
have a saying about three kinds of sick person-is this so or
not?" Sha said, "It is so." Tsang said, "I have eyes, ears, nose,
and tongue-how will you guide me, Teacher?" Hsuan Sha
immediately stopped. If you can understand Hsuan Sha's
meaning, how could it be in the words and phrases? Ti Tsang's
understanding was naturally outstanding.
Later a monk took this story up with Yun Men. Men im­
mediately understood his intentions and said, "Bow." The
monk bowed and rose. Men poked at him with his staff, and
the monk drew back. Men said, "You're not blind." Then Men
called him closer. When the monk approached, Men said,
"You're not deaf." Next he said, "Do you understand?" When
the monk said, "I don't understand," Men said, "You're not
mute." At this the monk attained insight. At the time, if the
monk had been for real, when Yun Men told him to bow he
would have immediately turned over his meditation seat. Then
how could so many complications have appeared? But tell me,
are Yun Men's understanding and Hsuan Sha's understanding

Eighty-eighth Case

485

the same or different? The understanding of those two men
was the same.
Look at how the Ancients appeared and created millions of
kinds of expedient methods. "The meaning is on the hook."
How much exertion to make each and every one of today's
people understand this one matter!
My late teacher Wu Tsu said, "One man can speak, though
he doesn't understand; one man, though he understands, can­
not speak. If these two men came calling, how would you be
able to discriminate between them? If you can't distinguish
these two, in fact you will be unable to free what is stuck and
untie what is bound for people. If you can distinguish them,
then as soon as you see them come through the gate, you put
on your straw sandals and walk around several times within
their bellies. If you still haven't awakened on your own, what
bowl are you looking for?b Go away!"
Now you better not make your understanding in terms of
blind, deaf, and mute. Thus it is said, "His eyes see forms as
though blind, and his ears hear sounds as though deaf." Again,
it was said,
Though it fills his eyes, he doesn't see form;
Though it fills his ears, he doesn't hear sound­
Manfusri is always covering his eyes,

A valokitesvara blocks his ears.
At this point, only if your eyes see as though blind and your
ears hear as though deaf will you be able to not be at odds with
Hsuan Sha's meaning. Do all of you know where the blind,
deaf, and mute fellows are at? Look closely at Hsueh Tau's
verse, which says,

VERSE

Blind, deaf, mute-

Already there before it's said. The three openings (eye,
ear, mouth) are all illumined. It's already been made into
one piece.
Soundless, without any adjustments to potentialities.

Where will you search? Can you make any judgments?
What have they got to do with it?

486

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

In the heavens, on earth-

With the correct principle, Hsueh Tau is on his own. I am
also thus.

Laugh at what? Lament over what? Half light, half dark.
Li Lii can't discern the true form;

Blind man! A skillful craftsman leaves no traces. Truly
blind!
How can Shih K'uang recognize the mystic tune!

Deaf man! No reward has been established for the great
achievement. Truly deaf.
How can this compare to sitting alone beneath an empty window!
You must be this way to attain. Don't make your living in

a ghost cave. Instantly Hsueh Tau smashes the lacquer
bucket.
The leaves fall, the flowers bloom-each in its own time.

What time and season is it right now? You mustn't under­
stand it as unconcern. Today goes from morning to eve­
ning and tomorrow too goes from morning to evening.
Again Hsueh Tou said, "Do you understand or not!"

Again he speaks the words of the verse.
An iron hammer head with no hole.

Take what's coming to you and get out! Too bad-Hsueh
Tau let go, so I'll hit.

COMMENTARY

"Blind, deaf, mute- I Soundless, without any adjustments to
potentialities." All your seeing and not seeing, hearing and not
hearing, speaking and not speaking-Hsueh Tau has swept it
all away at once for you. In fact, views in terms of blindness,
deafness, and muteness, and calculations and judgments of
what's right to suit potentials are at once silenced and cut off;
none of them can be applied. This transcendental matter can be
called real blindness, real deafness, real muteness, without po­
tentials and without adjustments.

Eighty-eighth Case

487

"In the heavens, on earth-/ Laughable, lamentable." Hsueh
Tau lifts up with one hand and pushes down with one hand.
But say, laugh at what? Lament over what? It's worth laughing
joyously that this blindness is not really blind, that this deaf­
ness is not really deaf, that this muteness is not really mute.
It's worth lamenting being clearly not blind, yet still being
blind, being clearly not deaf, yet still being deaf, being clearly
not mute, yet still being mute.
"Li Lii can't discern the true form." If you can't tell green
from yellow or red from white, then you're really blind. Li Lu
was a man of the time of the Yellow Emperor (third millen­
nium B.C.); from a hundred paces away he could see the tip of
the finest hair-his eyes were very clear. As the Yellow Em­
peror was crossing the Red River, he dropped a pearl down into
the water; he ordered Li Lu to look for it, but he couldn't find
it. He ordered Ch'i Hou to search for it, but he couldn't find it
either. Finally he ordered Hsiang Wang to look, and he at last
recovered it. Thus it was said, "Hsiang Wang's glory shone
bright at all times; Li Lii's actions were like waves flooding the
sky." Even Li Lu's eye can't discern the true form of this lofty
place.
"How can Shih K'uang recognize the mystic tune?" In Chou
times (first millennium B.C.) Duke Ching of Chin had a son
(some say it was the music teacher of Duke P'ing of Chin)
named Shih K'uang Tzu Yeh, who was well able to distinguish
the five notes and six pitches. He could hear the sound of ants
fighting on the other side of a mountain. At that time (the
states of) Chin and Ch'u were contending for hegemony. Shih
K'uang had but to strum his guitar and set the strings in mo­
tion in order to know that Ch'u would have no success in the
war. Although he was like this, Hsueh Tau says that even he
would be unable to recognize the mystic tune. People who,
even though they are not deaf, are nonetheless still deaf, even if
they were Shih K'uang, still couldn't recognize the mystic tune
of this lofty place.
Hsueh Tau says, "I am not Li Lu, nor am I Shih K'uang­
how can this compare to sitting alone beneath an empty win­
dow? The leaves fall, the flowers bloom-each in its own
time." If you get to this realm, though you see, it's like not
seeing; though you hear, it's like not hearing; though you
speak, it's like not speaking. When hungry you eat and when

488

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

tired you sleep. You let the leaves fall and the flowers bloom.
When the leaves fall it's autumn; when the flowers bloom it's
spring-each has its own time and season.
Having swept it clean for you, Hsueh Tau again puts down a
single path and says, "Do you understand or not?" Hsueh
Tau's strength is exhausted and his spirit wearied; he can just
manage to say, "An iron hammer head with no (handle) hole."
Be quick to set your eyes on this line; only then will you see. If
you hesitate, you've missed it again.
(Master Yuan Wu held up his whisk and said,) Do you see?
(Then he rapped once on the meditation seat and said,) Do you
hear? (Then he came down from his seat and said,) Can you
speak?

TRANSLATORS NOTES

a.

"Golden chains" is a classic Buddhist metaphor for the moral
code or behavioral discipline, one of the three Buddhist studies.
Though one renounces society to become a monk or nun, and is
thus freed from the problems of secular life, one is said to be still
bound by the "golden chains" of precepts. Attachment to pre­
cepts, pride in one's way of life, or belief in the efficacy of mere
morality or ritual, is called a form of bondage in Buddhist teach­
ing. In Ch'an this is extended to refer to the whole of the Buddhist
teachings, to all sense of realization or attainment, attachment to
holiness, which still must be transcended before one is really free.
This is like the image of "gold dust in the eyes"; though gold
(Buddha Dharma) is precious, gold chains still bind and gold dust
still blinds: the qualities of Buddhahood are not to be set up as
external objects of attainment.

The "bowl," from which one eats and drinks, symbolizes a line of
reasoning or doctrine which one attempts to use to get the
"nourishment" of understanding.

EIGHTY-NINTH CASE

The Hands and Eyes of the
Bodhisattva of Great Compassion

POINTER

If your whole body were an eye, you still wouldn't be able to
see it. If your whole body were an ear, you still wouldn't be able
to hear it. If your whole body were a mouth, you still wouldn't
be able to speak of it. If your whole body were mind, you still
wouldn't be able to perceive it.
Now leaving aside "whole body" for the moment, if sud­
denly you had no eyes, how would you see? Without ears, how
would you hear? Without a mouth, how would you speak?
Without a mind, how would you perceive? Here, if you can
unfurl a single pathway, then you'd be a fellow student with
the ancient Buddhas. But leaving aside "studying" for the mo­
ment, under whom would you study?

Yun Yen asked Tao Wu, "What does the Bodhisattva of Great
Compassion use so many hands and eyes for? "1

Wu said, "How do you understand it?

Yen said, "All over the body are hands and eyes.''5

There's no different dirt in the same hole. When the manservant
sees the maidservant, he takes care. A leper drags along his com­
panions.

too should be challenged.

8.

The frog cannot leap out of the basket. He's snatched your eyes

or not? He's calling daddy poppa.

COMMENTARY

Yun Yen and Tao Wu were fellow students under Yao Shan. For
forty years Yun Yen's side did not touch his mat. Yao Shan
produced the whole Ts'ao-Tung school. There were three men
with whom the Path of Dharma flourished: descended from
Yun Yen was Tung Shan; descended from Tao Wu was Shih
Shuang; and descended from Ch'uan Tzu was Chia Shan.
The Bodhisattva of Great Compassion (Avalokitesvara) has
eighty-four thousand symbolic arms. Great Compassion has
this many hands and eyes-do all of you? Pai Chang said, "All
sayings and writings return to one's self."
Yun Yen often followed Tao Wu, to study and ask questions
to settle his discernment with certainty. One day he asked
him, "What does the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion use so
many hands and eyes for?" Right at the start Tao Wu should
have given him a blow of the staff across his back, to avoid so
many

complications

appearing

later.

But

Tao

Wu

was

compassionate-he couldn't be like this. Instead, he gave Yun
Yen an explanation of the reason, meaning to make him under­
stand immediately. Instead (of hitting him) Tao Wu said, "It's

Eighty-ninth Case

491

like someone reaching back groping for a pillow in the middle
of the night." Groping for a pillow in the depths of the night
without any lamplight-tell me, where are the eyes?
Yun Yen immediately said, "I understand." Wu said, "How
do you understand it?" Yen said, "All over the body are hands
and eyes." Wu said, "You have said quite a bit there, but you've
only said eighty percent of it." Yen said, "What do you say,
Elder Brother?" Wu said, "Throughout the body are hands and
eyes."
But say, is "all over the body" right, or is "throughout the
body" right? Although they seem covered with mud, neverthe­
less they are bright and clean. People these days often make up
emotional interpretations and say that "all over the body" is
wrong, while "throughout the body" is right-they're merely
chewing over the Ancients' words and phrases. They have died
in the Ancients' words, far from realizing that the Ancients'
meaning isn't in the words, and that all talk is used as some­
thing that can't be avoided. People these days add footnotes
and set up patterns, saying that if one can penetrate this case,
then this can be considered understanding enough to put an
end to study. Groping with their hands over their bodies and
over the lamp and the pillar, they all make a literal understand­
ing of "throughout the body." If you understand this way, you
degrade those Ancients quite a bit.
Thus it is said, "He studies the living phrase; he doesn't
study the dead phrase." You must cut off emotional defile­
ments and conceptual thinking, become clean and naked, free
and unbound-only then will you be able to see this saying
about Great Compassion.
Haven't you heard how Ts'ao Shan asked a monk, "How is it
when (the Dharmakaya, the body of reality) is manifesting
form in accordance with beings, like the moon (reflected) in the
water?" The monk said, "Like an ass looking at a well." Shan
said, "You have said quite a lot, but you've only said eighty
percent of it." The monk said, "What do you say, Teacher?"
Shan said, "It's like the well looking at the ass." This is the
same meaning as the main case.
If you go to their words to see, you'll never be able to get out
of Tao Wu's and Yun Yen's trap. Hsueh Tou, as an adept, no
longer dies in the words; he walks right on Tao Wu's and Yun
Yen's heads to versify, saying,

Hsueh Tau's right?"
Bah!
After three or four shouts, then what?

Eighty-ninth Case

493

COMMENTARY

"All over the body is right-/ Throughout the body is right."
Whether you say reaching back with the hand groping for a
pillow is it, or running the hand over the body is it, if you make
up such interpretations, you're doing nothing but making your
living in a ghost cave. In the end neither "all over the body" nor
"throughout the body" is right. If you want to see this story of
Great Compassion by means of emotional consciousness, in
fact you're still a hundred thousand miles awaY: Hsueh Tou
can play with a phrase-reviving, he says, "Bringing it up is
still a hundred thousand miles away."
In the subsequent lines Hsueh Tou versifies what was ex­
traordinary about Tao Wu and Yun Yen, saying, "Spreading its
wings, the Roc soars over the clouds of the six compoundsa-/
It propels the wind to beat against the waters of the four
oceans." The great Roc swallows dragons: with his wings he
sends the wind to beat against the waters; the waters part, then
the Roc captures the dragon and swallows it. Hsueh Tou is
saying that if you can propel the wind against the waves like
the great Roc, you would be very brave and strong indeed.

If such actions are viewed with the thousand hands and eyes
of the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion, it's just a little bit of
dust suddenly arising, or like a wisp of hair ceaselessly blown
by the wind. Hsueh Tou says, "If you take running the hands
over the body as the hands and eyes of Great Compassion, what
is this good for?" In fact this is just not enough for this story of
the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion. Thus, Hsueh Tou says,
"What speck of dust suddenly arises? I What wisp of hair hasn't
stopped?"
Hsueh Tou said of himself that an adept at once wipes away
his tracks. Nevertheless, at the end of the verse as usual he
broke down and gave a comparison-as before, he's still in the
cage. "You don't see? I The net of jewels hanging down in
patterns, reflections upon reflections." Hsueh Tou brings out
the clear jewels of Indra's net to use as patterns hanging down.
But tell me, where do the hands and eyes come to rest?
In the Hua Yen school they designate four Dharma realms:
first, the Dharma realm of principle, to explain one-flavor
equality; second, the Dharma realm of phenomena, to explain
that principle in its entirety becomes phenomena. Third, the

494

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Dharma realm of principle and phenomena unobstructed, to
explain how principle and phenomena merge without hin­
drance; fourth, the Dharma realm of no obstruction among
phenomena, to explain that every phenomenon everywhere en­
ters all phenomena, that all things everywhere embrace all
things, all intermingling simultaneously without obstruction.
Thus it is said, "As soon as a single speck of dust arises, the
whole earth is contained therein; each atom contains bound­
less Dharma realms. That being so for each atom, it is so for all
atoms."
As for the net of jewels; in front of Indra's Dharma Hall of
Goodness, there's a net made of jewels. Hundreds of thousands
of jewels are reflected in every individual jewel, and each jewel
is reflected in hundreds of thousands of jewels. Center jewel
and surrounding jewels reflect back and forth, multiplying and
remultiplying the images endlessly. This is used to illustrate
the Dharma realm of no obstruction among phenomena.
In the old days National Teacher Hsien Shou set up a dem­
onstration using mirrors and a lamp. He placed ten mirrors
around the circumference (of a room) and put a lamp in the
center. If you observed any one mirror, you saw nine mirrors
mirroring the lamp, mirrors and lamp all appearing equally and
perfectly clearly.
Thus when the World Honored One first achieved true en­
lightenment, without leaving the site of enlightenment he as­
cended into all the heavens of the thirty-three celestial king­
doms, and at nine gatherings in seven places he expounded the
Hua Yen scripture.
Hsueh Tou uses Indra's jewel net to impart the teaching of
the Dharma realm of no obstruction among phenomena. The
six aspectsb are very clear; that is, the all-inclusive, the sepa­
rate, the sameness, the difference, the formation, and the disin­
tegration. Raise one aspect and all six are included. Because
living beings in their daily activities are unaware of it, Hsueh
Tou raises the clear jewels of Indra's net hanging down in pat­
terns to describe this saying about the Bodhisattva of Great
Compassion. It's just like this: if you are well able, amidst the
jewel net, to understand the staff and the marvellous function­
ing of supernatural powers going out and coming in un­
obstructed, then you can see the hands and eyes of the
Bodhisattva. That's why Hsueh Tou says, "Where do the hands

realization at the staff and obtain fulfillment at a shout.
When Te Shan hit people as soon as they came in through
the gate, when Lin Chi shouted at people as soon as they came
in through the gate, tell me, where were the hands and eyes?
And tell me, why did Hsueh Tou go on at the end to utter the

word "Bah! 11? Investigate!

TRANSLATORS NOTES

a.

The six compounds are the six senses-eye, ear, nose, tongue,
body, and mind, and their respective sense-fields.

b.

The six aspects of all things are defined in terms of the interde­
pendent coproduction or relative coexistence of all things. The
classic metaphor is of a house: the house represents the all­
inclusive aspect, its beams and such represent the separate, or
distinct aspect; since the beams, etc., join to form a house and
nothing else, this is their aspect of sameness, but since they de­
pend on each other as individual parts which are not the same,
this is their aspect of difference. As they collectively create a
house, this is the aspect of formation, but since each part has its
own position and does not individually create anything, this is
the aspect of disintegration. Put another way, one compound con­
tains many elements or qualities; this is the all-inclusive aspect.
The many qualities or elements are not one; this is the separate,
or distinct aspect. Many functions or meanings are not at odds
with each other; this is the aspect of sameness. From these many
functions or meanings, interdependent co-production takes place;
this is the aspect of formation. These conditions each abide in
their own nature, without moving; this is the aspect of disintegra­
tion. (This explanation is from the section on Fa Yen Ch'an in the

fen T'ien Yen Mu, "Eye of Humans and Gods.")

COMMENTARY

When Chih Men said, "An oyster swallowing the bright moon"
and" A rabbit getting pregnant/' in both he used a mid-autumn
sense; even so, the Ancient's meaning was not in the oyster or
the rabbit. As Chih Men was a venerable adept in the congrega­
tion of Yun Men, b each of his phrases had to contain three
phrases; that is, the phrase that contains heaven and earth, the
phrase that cuts off the myriad streams, and the phrase that
follows the waves. Moreover, without using any prearranged
maneuvers, each of his phrases is spontaneously appropriate.
Thus he went to the danger point to answer this monk's ques­
tions, showing a bit of his sharp point-he was undeniably
extraordinary. Nevertheless, this ancient never played with the
shadows of a light, he just pointed out a bit of a road for you to
make you see.
This monk said, "What is the body of wisdom?" Chih Men
said, "An oyster swallowing the bright moon." Oysters contain
bright pearls: (it is said that) when the mid-autumn moon
comes out, the oysters float to the surface, open their mouths,
and swallow the moonlight; from the effects of this, pearls are
produced. If there is moonlight in mid-autumn, the pearls are
many; without a moon, the pearls are few.
The monk also asked, "What is the function of wisdom?"
Chih Men said, "A rabbit getting pregnant." The meaning of
this is no different. The rabbit belongs to (the female, negative
principle) Yin (to which the moon also belongs); in mid­
autumn when the moon comes out, the rabbits open their
mouths and swallow its light, thus becoming pregnant. Here
too, if there's moonlight the offspring are many; without a
moon, they're few.
That Ancient's answer was free from so many concerns; he
just made temporary use of these meanings to answer about
the light of wisdom. Although his answer was this way, his
meaning wasn't in the words and phrases. It's just that later
people go to his words to make a living. Haven't you heard how
P' an Shan said,
The mind-moon is solitary and full:
Its light engulfs the myriad forms.

An Ancient said, "Day and night all of you people release a

great light from the gates of your six senses; it shines through
mountains, rivers, and the great earth. It's not only your eyes
that release light-nose, tongue, body and mind also all release
light." To get here you simply must clean up your six sense
faculties so that you're without the slightest concern, purified
and naked, free and unbound-only then will you see where
this story is at. Hsueh Tau does his verse just this way:

VERSE

One piece of empty solidity, beyond saying and feeling;
Stir your mind and you err, move your thoughts and
you're obstructed. Not even Buddha's eye can catch sight
of it.
From this humans and gods see Subhuti.

struggle.
When shields and spears are already at rest, then there's
great peace under heaven. Do you understand? I hit, say­
ing, "How many blows can you take, Reverend?"

Ninetieth Case

499

COMMENTARY

"One piece of empty solidity, beyond saying and feeling." With
a single line, Hsueh Tau has versified it well: naturally he can
see the Ancient's meaning. What is it that the six senses are
brimming with? It's just this one mass, empty and bright, solid
and quiescent. You don't need to go to heaven to look for it.
You don't have to seek it from someone else. The perpetual
light spontaneously appears before us: right here in this very
place it towers up like a mile-high wall, beyond verbal appella­
tion and mental sense.
Fa Yen's verse on perfect reality says,
When reasoning is exhausted, saying and feeling are
forgotten;
How could this be properly described!
Wherever I go, the frosty night's moon
Falls as it may on the valley ahead.
The fruits are ripe and heavy with monkeys,
The mountains go on so far it seems I've lost my
way.
When I raise my head, there's a remnant of illumi­
nation leftActually this is west of my dwelling place.

Thus it is said,
Mind is the faculty, things are the objects;
Both are like flaws on a mirror.
When the defilement of objects is obliterated, the
light first appears.
When mind and things are both forgotten, nature is
real.

It is also said,
I've always lived in a three-section reed hut;
In the spiritual light of the one Path, myriad objects
are at rest.
Don't use right and wrong to judge meFleeting life and its rationalizations have nothing to
do with me.

500

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

These verses too make you see "One piece of empty solidity,
beyond saying and feeling."
"From this humans and gods see Subhuti." Haven't you
heard how Subhuti was sitting quietly on a cliff when all the
gods showered him with flowers to praise him: the venerable
Subhuti said, "Who is showering down these flowers in
praise?" A god said, "I am Brahma." Subhuti said, "Why are
you offering praise?" The god said, "I honor you for being good
at expounding the transcendance of wisdom." Subhuti said, "I
have never spoken a single word about wisdom; why offer
praise?" The god said, "You didn't speak and I didn't hear-no
speaking and no hearing is true wisdom," and again he caused
the earth to tremble and flowers to shower. See how Subhuti
expounded wisdom so well, without speaking of its body or its
function. If at this you can see, then you can see Chih Men's
saying, "An oyster swallowing the bright moon" and "A rabbit
getting pregnant."
Though the Ancient's meaning was not in the spoken
phrases, nevertheless in his answer there was a deep, deep
meaning. This caused Hsueh Tou to say, "The oyster swallow­
ing, the mysterious rabbit-deep, deep meaning." Here, "Hav­
ing been given to Ch'an people, it makes them fight and strug­
gle." The followers of Ch'an in the world have haggled over
Chih Men's answers profusely and noisily; there's never been a
single person who has even seen him in a dream. If you want to
be a fellow student with Chih Men and Hsueh Tou, you must
first set your eyes on it for yourself.

Yen Kuan's Rhinoceros

POINTER

To transcend emotion, detach from views, remove bonds and
dissolve sticking points, to uphold the fundamental vehicle of
transcendence and support the treasury of the eye of the true
Dharma, you must also respond equally in all ten directions, be
crystal clear in all respects, and directly attain to such a realm.
But tell me, are there any who attain alike, realize alike, die
alike and live alike? To test, I cite this to see.

CASE

One day Yen Kuan called to his attendant, "Bring me my
rhinoceros-horn fan."1
The attendant said, "The fan is broken."2
Yen Kuan said, "If the fan is broken, bring the rhinoceros
back to me."3
The attendant had no reply.4
T'ou Tzu said, "I do not refuse to bring it out, but I fear the
horn on its head will be imperfect."5 Hsueh Tou commented,
"I want an imperfect horn."6

Shih Shuang said, "If I return it to the Master, then I won't
have it."7 Hsueh Tou commented, "The rhino is still there."8
Tzu Fu drew a circle and wrote the word 'rhino' inside it.9
Hsueh Tou commented, "Why did you not bring it out be­
fore? "10
Pao Fu said, "The Master is aged; he should ask someone
else."11 Hsueh Tou commented, "What a pity to have worked
hard without accomplishing anything."1 2

COMMENTARY

Yen Kuan one day called to his attendant, "Bring me my
rhinoceros-hom fan." Although this matter does not lie in
words, yet if you want to test someone's ordinary disposition
and ability, still it is necessary to be able to use words in this
way to show it. On the last day of the last month of your life, if
you can find strength and be the Master, even when myriad
visions appear in profusion, you can look upon them without
being moved: this can be called accomplishment without ac­
complishment, effortless power.
Yen Kuan was Ch'an Master Chi An; he used to have a fan
made of rhinoceros horn. At the time, how could Yen Kuan not
have known that the fan was broken? He purposely asked the
attendant, and the attendant said, "The fan is broken." Ob­
serve how that Ancient was always within It twenty-four
hours a day, encountering It everywhere; Yen Kuan said, "If the
fan is broken, bring the rhinoceros back to me." But tell me,
what did he want with the rhinoceros? He just wanted to test
the man to see whether or not he knew where it was at.

Ninety-first Case

503

T'ou Tzu said, "I do not refuse to bring it out, but I fear the
head's horn will be imperfect." Hsueh Tau said, "I want the
imperfect hom." He too goes to the phrase to match wits.
Shih Shuang said, "If I return it to the Master, then I won't
have it." Hsueh Tau says, "The rhino is still there."
Tzu Fu drew a circle and wrote the word "rhino" inside;
because he had succeeded to Yang Shan, he always liked to use
objects to teach people and illustrate this matter. Hsueh Tau
says, "Why didn't you bring it out before?" He pierced his
nostrils too.
Pao Fu said, "The Master is aged; he should ask someone
else." These words are most appropriate; the preceding three
quotes are after all easy to see, but the words of this one phrase
have a profound meaning. Yet Hsueh Tau has broken them up
too. When I was at Librarian Ch'ing's place in the old days, I
understood the reasoning; he said, "The Master is old and
senile; getting the head, he forgets the tail-before he sought
the fan, now he seeks the rhinoceros; it is hard to attend to
him, and therefore (Pao Fu) said, 'Better ask someone else.'"
Hsueh Tau said, "What a pity to work hard without ac­
complishing anything."
All these were in the form of remarks: the Ancients saw
through this matter, so though each was different, when they
spoke forth, they hit the mark a hundred times out of a
hundred, always having a way to show forth; each phrase does
not lose the bloodline. People these days, when they are ques­
tioned, just make up theoretical judgments and comparisons;
that is why I want people to chew on this twenty-four hours a
day, making every drop of water a drop of ice, seeking the
experience of enlightenment. See how Hsueh Tau versified it
on one thread, saying,

VERSE

The rhinoceros-horn fan has long been in use,
In summer, cool; in winter, warm. Everyone has it; why

don't they know? Who has never used it?
But when asked, actually nobody knows.
They know, but they don't understand. Better not fool

people. And you shouldn't suspect anyone else.

out wnd.

Just like the clouds and rain, when gone, are difficult to pur­
sue.
Heavens! Heavens! Still this is losing one's money and
incurring punishment anyway.
Hsueh Tau also said, "If you want the pure breeze to return,
and the horn to regrow,! I ask you Ch'an followers to each turn
a word. 2 I ask you, since the fan is broken, return the
rhinoceros to me."3
At that time a monk came forth and said, "Everyone, go
meditate in the hall! "4
Hsueh Tau said, "I cast my hook fishing for whales, but
caught a frog." Then he got down from the seat.5

COMMENTARY

"The rhinoceros-horn fan has long been in use, I But when
asked, actually nobody knows." Everyone has this fan, and
throughout the twenty-four hours of the day is in complete
possession of its power-why is it that when asked, no one
knows where it's gone? The attendant, T'ou Tzu, all the way
down to Pao Fu-neither do any of them know. But tell me,
does Hsueh Tau know?

Ninety-first Case

505

Have you not seen how when Wu Cho called on Manjusri, as
they were drinking tea, Manjusri held up a crystal bowl and
asked, "Do they have this in the South?" Wu Cho said, "No."
Manjusri said, "What do they usually use to drink tea?" Wu
Cho was speechless. If you know what this public case is
about, then you will know that the rhinoceros-horn fan has a
boundless pure breeze; you will also see the horn towering on
the rhino's head.
The four old fellows speaking as they did were like the
morning clouds and evening rain; once gone, they are difficult
to pursue. Hsueh Tou also said, "If you want the pure breeze to
return and the horn to regrow, I ask you Ch'an followers to
each utter a turning word: I ask you, since the fan is broken,
return the rhinoceros to me." At that moment a Ch'an follower
came forth and said, "Everyone, go meditate in the hall!" This
monk has usurped the Master's sceptre of authority. He cer­
tainly could speak, but he was only able to say eighty percent.
If you want a hundred percent, then throw the meditation seat
over for him. Now, you tell me, did this monk understand the
rhinoceros or not? If he did not understand, yet he knew how to
speak in this way; if he did understand, why did Hsueh Tou not
approve of him? Why did he say, "I cast a hook fishing for
whales, but only caught a frog."
Tell me, ultimately how is it? Everyone, there's nothing to
worry about; try to hold it up to view.

who can stand witness? To test, I cite this to see.

there was this scene. From the beginning at the Deer Parkb to

Ninety-second Case

507

the end at the Hiranyavati River,C how many times did he use
the jewel sword of the Diamond King? At that time, if among
the crowd there had been someone with the spirit of a patch­
robed monk who could transcend, he would have been able to
avoid the final messy scene of raising the flower. While the
World Honored One paused, he was confronted by Manjusri,
and immediately got down from his seat. At that time, there
was still this scene; Shakyamuni barred his door, Vimalakirti
shut his mouth-both resemble this, and thus have already
explained it. It is like the story of Su Tsung asking National
Teacher Chung about making a seamless memorial tower,ct and
also like the story of the outsider asking Buddha, "I do not ask
about the spoken or the unspoken."e Observe the behavior of
those transcendent people; when did they ever enter a ghost
cave for their subsistence? Some say that the meaning lies in
the silence; some say it lies in the pause, that speech illumines
what cannot be said, and speechlessness illumines what can be
said-as Yung Chia said, "Speaking when silent, silent when
speaking." But if you only understand in this way, then past,
present, and future, for sixty aeons, you will still never have
seen it even in dreams. If you can immediately and directly
attain fulfillment, then you will no longer see that there is
anything ordinary or holy-this Dharma is equanimous, it has
no high or low. Every day you will walk hand in hand with all
the Buddhas.
Finally, observe how Hsueh Tou naturally sees and produces
it in verse:

VERSE

Among the assembled multitude of sages, if an adept had
known,
Better not slander old Shakyamuni. Leave it up to Lin Chi
or Te Shan. Among a thousand or ten thousand, it's hard
to find one or a half.
The command of the King of Dharma wouldn't have been like
this.
Those who run after him are as plentiful as hemp and
millet. Three heads, two faces. Clearly. How many could
there be who could reach here?

adept, you sure aren't.

ation? angerous!

COMMENTARY

"Among the assembled multitude of sages, if an adept had
known." The great mass of eighty thousand on Vulture Peak
all were ranked among the sages: Manjusri, Samantabhadra,
and so on, including Maitreya; master and companions were
assembled together-they had to be the skilled among the
skillful, the outstanding among the outstanding, before they
would know what he was getting at. What Hsueh Tou intends
to say is that among the multitude of sages, there was not a
single man who knew what is: if there had been an adept, then
he would have known what was not so. Why? Manjusri struck
the gavel and said, "Clearly behold the Dharma of the King of
Dharma; the Dharma of the King of Dharma is thus." Hsueh
Tou said, "The command of the King of Dharma is not like
this." Why so? At the time, if there had been in the assembly a
fellow with an eye on his forehead and a talisman at his side, he
would have seen all the way through before the World Honored
One had even ascended the seat; then what further need would
there be for Manjusri to strike the gavel?
The Nirvana Scripture says, "Saindhava is one name for
four actual things: one is salt, the second is water, the third is a
bowl, and the fourth is a horse. There was a wise attendant
who well understood the four meanings: if the king wanted to
wash, and needed saindhava, the attendant would then bring
him water; when he asked for it when eating, then he served
him salt; when the meal was done, he offered him a bowl to
drink hot water; and when he wanted to go out, he presented a
horse. He acted according to the king's intention without error;
clearly one must be a clever fellow to be able to do this."

saindhava?" Chou got off his meditation seat, bent over and
folded his hands. At this time if there had been a "saindhava
man" who could penetrate before the World Honored One had
even ascended his seat, then he would have attained some­
what. The World Honored One yet ascended his seat, and then
immediately got down; already he hadn't got to the point­
how was it worth Manjusri's still striking the gavel? He un­
avoidably made the World Honored One's sermon seem
foolish. But tell me, where was it that he made a fool of him?

the other like this, when will you ever find rest? Ta Kuang said,
"Wild fox spirit"-these words cut off Chin Niu, and are un­
deniably outstanding. That is why it is said, "He studies the
living word, not the dead word." Hsueh Tou just likes his say­
ing "You wild fox spirit!" That is the basis on which he pro­
duces his verse. But tell me, is this "wild fox spirit" the same
as or different from "Tsang's head is white; Hai's head is
black,"d "This lacquer bucket! "e or "Good monk!"? Just tell
me, are these the same or different? Do you know? You meet

"This wild fox spirit!" This was the second arrow. This has
been the tooth and nail since time immemorial.
"Who says yellow leaves are yellow gold?" Yang Shan said
to his community, "You people should each tum back your
light and reflect; do not memorize my words. Since beginning­
less aeons you have turned your backs on the light and plunged
into darkness; the roots of your false conceptions are deep, and
after all are hard to pull out all at once. That is why I temporar­
ily set up expedient methods to take away your coarse dis­
criminating consciousness; this is like using yellow leaves to
stop a little child's crying." It is like exchanging sweet fruit for
bitter gourd. The Ancients provisionally established expedient
methods to help people; when their crying has stopped, yellow
leaves are not gold.C When the World Honored One explained
timely doctrines throughout his lifetime, these too were just
talks to put an end to crying. "This wild fox!"-he just wanted
to transmute the other's active discriminating consciousness;
within (the process) there are provisional and real, there are
also illumination and function; only thus can you see the grasp
of the patchrobed monk there. If you can understand, you'll be
like a tiger with folded wings.
"If the waves of Ts'ao Ch'i were alike."g If suddenly all the
students in all quarters did a dance like this, and only acted
like this, then innumerable ordinary people would get bogged
down; how could they be saved?

COMMENTARY

In the Surangama scripture it says, "When I don't see, why
don't you see my not seeing? If you see my not seeing, natu­
rally that is not the characteristic of not seeing. If you don't see
my not seeing, it is naturally not a thing; how could it not be
you?" Hsueh Tau here does not quote the entire passage of the
scripture; if it is quoted in full, then it can be seen. The scrip­
ture says,b "If seeing were a thing, then you could also see my
sight. If seeing alike were called seeing my (seeing), when I
don't see, why don't you see my not seeing? If you see my not
seeing, naturally that is not the characteristic of not seeing. If
you don't see my not seeing, naturally it is not a thing; how
could it not be you?" The words are many, and I won't record
them. Ananda intended to say, "The lamps and pillars in the
world all can be given names; I also want the World Honored
One to point out this subtle spiritual fundamental il­
lumination-what can you call it, to let me see the Buddha's
intent?" The World Honored One says, "I see the incense
stand." Ananda says, "I also see the incense stand; then this is
the Buddha's sight." The World Honored One says, "When I
see the incense stand, then that can be known; when I do not
see the incense stand, then how will you see?" Ananda says,
"When I don't see the incense stand, then this is seeing the
Buddha." The Buddha says, "If I say I don't see, this is my own
knowledge; when you say you don't see, this is your own
knowledge-where another doesn't see, how can you know?"
The ancients said that when you get here, you can only know
for yourself; you can't explain to others. Just as the World
Honored One said, "When I do not see, why don't you see my
not seeing? If you see my not seeing, naturally that is not the
characteristic of not seeing. If you do not see my not seeing,
naturally it is not a thing; how could it not be you?" If you say
you acknowledge sight as an existent thing, you are not yet
able to wipe away the traces. "When I don't see" is like the
antelope with his horns hung up-all echo of sound, traces of
tracks, all breath is utterly gone; where will you turn to search
for him? The sense of the scripture is total indulgence in the
beginning and total restraint in the end. Hsueh Tau goes be­
yond the eye of the scriptural teachings to versify: he neither

516

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

eulogizes things, nor seeing or not seeing; he just eulogizes
seeing Buddha.

VERSE

"The Whole Elephant" or "The Whole Ox" -as blinding
cataracts, they're no different.

Half-blind man! Half open, half closed. What are you do­
ing, clinging to fences and groping along walls? One cut,
two pieces.
Adepts of all time have together been naming and describing.
Twenty-eight (Patriarchs) in India, six in China, all the

old teachers in the world, numerous as hemp and millet
seeds-yet you have still left yourself out.
If you want to see the yellow-faced old fellow right now,

Bah! The old barbarian! Blind fellow! He's right at your
feet.
Each atom of every land lies halfway there.
Where you stand you've already missed him. What more

would you have me say? Will you ever see him, even in a
dream?

COMMENTARY

"The Whole Elephant or the Whole Ox-as blinding cataracts,
they're no different." A group of blind people groping over an
elephant each speaks of a different aspect; this comes from the
Nirvana scripture. A monk asked Yang Shan, "Master, when

you saw someone come and ask about Ch'an or ask about the
Way, you then drew a circle, and wrote the word 'ox' inside it;
where does the meaning of this lie?" Yang Shan said, "This too
is an idle matter: if you immediately can understand, it doesn't
come from outside; if you cannot understand immediately, you
certainly don't recognize it. Now I ask you, what have the aged
adepts in various places pointed out in your body as your
Buddha-nature? Do you consider it that which speaks, or is it
that which is silent? Is it not that which neither speaks nor is
silent? Or do you consider everything to be it, or do you con-

Ninety-fourth Case

517

sider that everything is not it? If you acknowledge that which
speaks as it, you are like the blind man who has grabbed on to
the elephant's tail. If you acknowledge that which is silent as
it, you are like the blind man grabbing the elephant's ear. If you
acknowledge that which neither speaks nor is silent as it, you
are like the blind man grabbing the elephant's trunk. If you say
everything is it, you are like the blind man grabbing the
elephant's four legs. If you say none are it, you abandon the
original elephant and fall into the view of emptiness. Accord­
ing to what these blind men perceive, they just attribute differ­
ent names and descriptions to the elephant. If you want to do
right, just avoid groping over the elephant: do not say percep­
tive awareness is it, yet do not say that is not it."
The Sixth Patriarch said, "Enlightenment basically has no
tree; the clear mirror also has no stand. Fundamentally there is
not a single thing; how is it possible to be defiled by any dust?"
He also said, "The Way fundamentally has no shape or form;
wisdom itself is the Way. To attain this understanding is called
true transcendent wisdom." One with clear eyes sees the
elephant and apprehends its entire body; the seeing of Buddha
nature is also like this.
The "whole ox" appears in the Chuang-tzu: Pao Ting, in
cutting up oxen, never saw the whole ox; he followed the
internal patterns to cut them apart; letting his cleaver glide
freely, he did not need to add any further effort. In the time it
takes to raise your eyes, head and hom, hoof and flesh were
separated of their own accord. He did so for nineteen years, and
his cleaver was still as sharp as though it had newly come from
the whetstone. This is called the "whole ox." Although he was
so excellent, Hsueh Tou says that even if you can be like this,
the whole elephant and the whole ox are no different from
blinding cataracts in the eyes. "Adepts of all time together
name and describe." Even adepts still grope inside without
finding. From Kasyapa on down through the patriarchs and
masters of India and China, the old teachers all over the world
are just naming and describing.
Hsueh Tou directly says, "If you want to see the old yellow­
facec right now, every atom of dust in every land lies halfway
there." Usually we say that each atom is a Buddha-land, each
leaf is a Shakyamuni. Even when all the atomic particles in the
cosmos can be seen in one atom, you're still only halfway

there; there is still another half of the way yonder. But tell me,
where is he? Old Shakyamuni didn't even know himself; how
would you have me explain?

TRANSLATORS NOTES

a.

The open ground symbolizes the stage of Buddhahood; the white
ox symbolizes the Dharmakaya, the body of reality, the ultimate
and universal body of all Buddhas. In the Saddharmapundarika
scripture, the white ox symbolizes the unique vehicle of Buddha­
hood. See also the appendix on Tung Shan's three falls in volume
two.

b.

This passage occurs in the second volume of the Surangama
scripture; we have translated according to the Sung dynasty
commentary of Tzu Jui. This scripture, whose title means
"Heroic Going," describes many psychological states and pitfalls
of meditation; it was one of the favorite scriptures of Ch'an stu­
dents, and numerous quotations from it are to be found in the
sayings of Ch'an masters.

c.

"Yellow-face" refers to Shakyamuni Buddha, who as a Buddha
represents all Buddhas and Buddhahood in general; the Buddha
was said to have golden skin, hence the epithet ''yellow face."

COMMENTARY

Ch'ang Ch'ing and Pao Fu, while in the community of Hsueh
Feng, were always reminding and awakening each other, engag­
ing in discussion. One day casually talking like this, (Ch'ang
Ch'ing) said, "Rather say that saints have the three poisons
than say that the Tathagata has two kinds of speech." The
Sanskrit word for saint, arhat, means killer of thieves;b by their
virtue and accomplishment they illustrate their name; they
cut off the nine times nine, or eighty-one kinds of passion, all
their leaks are already dried up ,C and their pure conduct is
already established-this is the state of sainthood, where there
is nothing more to learn. The three poisons are greed, hatred,
and folly, the fundamental passions. If they have themselves
completely cut off the eighty-one kinds (of passion), how much
more so the three poisons! Ch'ang Ch'ing said, "Rather say
that saints have the three poisons, but don't say that the
Tathagata has two kinds of speech." His general idea was that
he wanted to show that the Tathagata does not say anything
untrue. In the Lotus of Truth scripture it says, "Only this one
thing is true;ct any second besides is not real." It also says,
"There is only one vehicle of truth; there is no second or
third." The World Honored One, in over three hundred as­
semblies, observed potentiality to set down his teachings, giv­
ing medicine in accordance with the disease: in ten thousand
kinds and a thousand varieties of explanations of the Dharma,
ultimately there are no two kinds of speech. His idea having
gotten this far, how can you people see? The Buddha widely
taught the Dharma with One Voice; this I don't deny-but
Ch'ang Ch'ing actually has never seen the Tathagata's speech
even in a dream. Why? It's just like a man talking about
food-after all that can't satisfy his hunger. Pao Fu saw him
talking about the doctrine on level ground, so he asked, "What

Ninety-fifth Case

521

is Tathagata speech?" Ch'ing said, "How can a deaf man hear
it?" This fellow (Pao Fu) knew that (Ch'ang Ch'ing) had been
making his living in a ghost cave for some time; Pao Fu said, "I
knew you were speaking on the secondary level." And after all
(Ch'ang Ch'ing) lived up to these words; he asked back, "Elder
brother, what is Tathagata speech?" Fu said, "Go drink tea."
(Ch'ang Ch'ing) had his spear snatched away by someone else;
Ch'ang Ch'ing, supposedly so great, lost his money and in­
curred punishment.
Now I ask everyone, how many (kinds of) Tathagata speech
are there? You should know that only when you can see in this
way, then you will see the defeat of these two fellows. If you
examine thoroughly, everyone should be beaten. I'll let out a
pathway, to let others comprehend. Some say that Pao Fu
spoke correctly, and that Ch'ang Ch'ing spoke incorrectly;
they just follow words to produce interpretations, so they say
there is gain and loss. They are far from knowing that the
Ancients were like stone struck sparks, like flashing lightning.
People nowadays do not go to the Ancients' turning point to
look; they just go running to the phrases and say, "Ch'ang
Ch'ing didn't immediately act; therefore he fell into the sec­
ondary lvel. Pao Fu's saying 'Go drink tea' is the primary
level." If you only look at it in this way, even by the time
Maitreya Buddha comes down to be born here, you still won't
see the Ancients' meaning. If you are an adept, you will never
entertain such a view; leaping out of this nest of cliche, you'll
have your own road upward.
If you say, "What is wrong with 'How could a deaf man
hear?'? What is right about 'Go drink tea'?" Then you are even
further from it. For this reason it is said, "He studies the living
phrase, he doesn't study the dead phrase." This story is the
same as the story of "It is all over the body; it is all through the
body"e-there is nowhere you can judge and compare right or
wrong. It is necessary for you to be clean and naked right where
you stand; only then will you see where the Ancients met. My
late teacher Wu Tsu said, "It is like coming to grips on the
front line." It requires a discerning eye and a familiar hand. In
this public case, if you see it with the true eye, where there is
neither gain nor loss, it distinguishes gain and loss; where
there is no near or far, it distinguishes near and far. Ch'ang
Ch'ing still should have bowed to Pao Fu to be proper. Why?

rolling or a comet flying. But Pao Fu couldn't help but produce

COMMENTARY

"Primary, secondary." If people only theoretically understand
primary and secondary, this indeed is making a living in dead
water. This active skill, if you only understand it in terms of
first or second, you will still be unable to get hold of it. Hsueh
Tou says, "A reclining dragon does not look to still water." In
dead water, how can there be a dragon hidden? If it is "primary

Ninety-fifth Case

523

and secondary," this indeed is making a livelihood in dead
stagnant water. There must be huge swells wide and vast,
white waves flooding the sky; only there can a dragon be con­
cealed. It is just like was said before; "A limpid pond does not
admit the blue dragon's coils." Have you not heard it said,
"Stagnant water does not contain a dragon." And it is said, "A
reclining dragon is always wary of the clarity of the blue pond."
That is why (Hsueh Tou) says that where there is no dragon,
there is the moon, the waves settle-the wind is calm, the
waves grow still. Where there is a dragon, waves rise without
wind; much like Pao Fu's saying "Go drink tea"-this indeed
is rousing waves without wind. Hsueh Tou at this point cleans
up emotional interpretations for you, and has completed the
verse. He has extra rhymes, so he makes the pattern complete;
as before he sets a single eye on the content, and again is unde­
niably outstanding. He says, "0 Ch'an traveller Leng! Ch'an
traveller Leng!r In the third month at the Gate of Yu, you get a
failing mark."g Although Ch'ang Ch'ing was a dragon who had
passed through the Dragon Gate, yet he got a tap right on the
head from Pao Fu.

Arhat also means "worthy"; that is, worthy of offerings.
"Leaks" are passions, attachments, defilements; the flow of
energy into habitual patterns of clinging, into emotional in­
volvement with the world, draining people of their will and mak­
ing them slaves of passion. The four knowledges of sainthood­
arhatship-are that one's leaks are dried up-that is, one is free
from affectation and affliction, that pure conduct has been estab­
lished, that one has done what was to be done, and that one is
freed from further existence in the profane state.

d.

The main idea of this scripture is that all sentient beings will
eventually realize Buddhahood, perfect enlightenment; "this one

is the vehicle of Buddhahood, within which the vehicles of disci­

tum into dragons and soar off into the clouds. In Chinese literary
convention this is used to symbolize the civil service examina­

symbolize the attainment of enlightenment. This first appears in

NINETY-SIXTH CASE

Chao Chou's Three Turning Words

CASE

Chao Chou expressed three turning words to his community.1
("A gold Buddha does not pass through a furnace; a wood
Buddha does not pass through fire; a mud Buddha does not pass
through water.")

NOTES

1.

What did he say? The three parts are not the same.

COMMENTARY

After Chao Chou had spoken these three turning words, in the
end he said, "The real Buddha sits within." This phrase is
exceedingly indulgent. That man of old set forth a single eye,
extended his hand to guide people; briefly making use of these
words to convey the message, he wanted to help others. If you
one-sidedly bring up the true imperative in its entirety, there
would be weeds ten feet deep in front of the teaching hall.
Hsueh Tau dislikes the indulgence of that final phrase, so he
omits it and just versifies three phrases. If a mud Buddha passes
through water it will dissolve; if a gold Buddha passes through
a furnace it will melt; if a wood Buddha passes through fire it
will bum up. What is difficult to understand about this? Hsueh
Tau's hundred examples of eulogizing the Ancients are com­
plicated with judgments and comparisons; only these three
verses directly contain the breath of a patchrobed monk. How­
ever, these verses are nevertheless difficult to understand. If
you can pass through these three verses, I'll allow as you have
finished studying.

COMMENTARY
"A mud Buddha does not pass through water: Spiritual Light
illumines heaven and earth." This one phrase clearly com­
pletes the verse: but tell me, why does he mention Shen Kuang
("Spiritual Light")? When the Second Patriarch was first born, a
spiritual light illumined the room, extending into the sky. Also
one night a spirit appeared and said to the Second Patriarch,
"Why remain here long? The time for you to attain the Way
has arrived: you should go South." Because of his association
with spirits, the Second Patriarch was eventually named Shen
Kuang (which means "Spiritual Light"). He lived for a long
time in the Yi-Lo area (Loyang), and widely studied many
books. He always lamented, "The teachings of Confucius and
Lao Tzu only transmit customary norms. Recently I have heard
that the great teacher Bodhidharma is dwelling at Shao Lin." So
he went there, visiting and knocking day and night; but
Bodhidharma sat still, and gave no instruction. Kuang thought
to himself, "When people of ancient times sought the Way,
they broke their bones and took out the marrow, shed their
blood to appease hunger, spread their hair to cover mud, threw
themselves off cliffs to feed tigers. Even of old they were like
this; what about me?"

Ninety-sixth Case

527

That year on the night of the ninth of December there was a
great snow. The Second Patriarch stood by the wall; by dawn
the snow had piled up past his knees. Bodhidharma took pity
on him and said, "You, standing in the snow there; what do
you seek?" The Second Patriarch sighed sadly and said, "I only
beg your compassion, to open up the gate of ambrosia, and save
all creatures." Bodhidharma said, "The wondrous path of all
the Buddhas requires zealous work over vast aeons, practicing
that which is difficult to practice, enduring the unendurable;
with little virtue and petty knowledge, a shallow heart and
arrogant mind, how can you hope to seek the true vehicle?
There is no way." The Second Patriarch, hearing this admoni­
tion, was even more earnest towards the Path; he secretly took
a sharp knife and cut off his own left forearm, and placed it
before Bodhidharma. Bodhidharma knew he was a vessel of
Dharma, so he asked him, "You stand in the snow and cut off
your arm; what for?" The Second Patriarch said, "My mind is
not yet at ease. Please, Master, ease my mind." Bodhidharma
said, "Bring forth your mind, and I will ease it for you." The
Second Patriarch said, "When I search for my mind, ultimately
I can't find it." Bodhidharma said, "I have put your mind at

ease

for

you."

Afterwards

Bodhidharma

changed

(Shen

Kuang's) name to Hui K'e. Later (Hui K'e) taught the Third
Patriarch, Great Master Seng Ts'an.
So Hsueh Tou says, "Standing in the snow, if he didn't rest,
who would not carve an imitation?" Slavishly fawning deceit­
ful people would all imitate him, at once becoming mere con­
trived false imitations: these are the obsequious phoney fol­
lowers. Hsueh Tou is eulogizing "A mud Buddha does not pass
through water"-why then does he bring up this story? He had
reached the absence of anything at all in his mind; clean and
naked, only thus could he versify like this.
Wu Tsu always used to have people look at these three
verses. Have you not seen how Master Shou Ch'u of Tung Shan
had a verse which he showed his community, saying,
Atop Mount Wu T'ai, clouds are steaming rice;
In front of the Ancient Buddha Hall, a dog is pissing

skyward.
Frying cakes atop the flagpole,
Three monkeys pitch pennies in the night.

arrived."

COMMENTARY

"A gold Buddha does not pass through a furnace; I A man
comes calling on Tzu Hu." This one phrase has also completed

Ninety-sixth Case

529

the verse. Why does he bring up "someone calling on Tzu Hu"?
Only with the forge and bellows of a Master is it possible.
Master Tzu Hu set up a sign on his outside gate; on the sign
were words saying, "Tzu Hu has a dog: above, he takes people's
heads; in the middle, he takes people's loins; below, he takes
people's legs. If you stop to talk to him, you'll lose your body
and life." Whenever he saw a newcomer, he would im­
mediately shout and say, "Watch out for the dog!" As soon as
the monk turned his head, Tzu Hu would immediately return
to the abbot's room. But tell me, why could he not bite Chao
Chou? Tzu Hu also once late at night shouted in the lavatory,
"Catch the thief! Catch the thief!" In the dark he ran into a
monk; he grabbed him by the chest and held him, saying,
"Caught him! Caught him!" The monk said, "Master, it's not
me." Hu said, "It is, but you just won't own up to it." If you can
understand this story, then you may chew everyone to death;
everywhere the pure wind will be chill and severe. If not, you
will certainly not be able to do anything about "the several
words on the sign." If you want to see him, just pass through
completely and then you will see what the verse is saying.

A wood Buddha does not pass through fire;
Burned up! Only I can know.

It is in my hands. I still don't need it. Who doesn't have it
in his hands?
And then one realizes he'd turned away from his self.
Just like you. If you can't find it out, what use is it? Alas!
Alas! After thirty years you'll finally get it. It is better to
be sunk forever than to see the liberation of the saints. If
you can seize it here, you'll still not avoid turning away.
How to be able not to tum away? The staff is still in

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD
COMMENTARY

"A wood Buddha does not pass through fire; I I always think of
the Oven Breaker." This one phrase also has completed the
verse. Hsueh Tou, because of this "wood Buddha does not pass
through fire," always thinks of the Oven Breaker. The "Oven
Breaker Monk" of Mount Sung was not known by any sur­
name; his speech and behavior were unfathomable. He dwelt
in seclusion on Mount Sung. One day, leading a group of fol­
lowers, he went among the mountain aborigines: they had a
shrine which was most sacred; in its hall was placed only an
oven. People from far and near sacrificed to it unceasingly; they
had immolated very many living creatures. The Master entered
the shrine and tapped the oven three times with his staff. He
said, "What humbug! You were originally made of brick and
mud compounded; where does the spirit come from, whence
does the sanctity originate, that you burn living creatures to
death like this?" And again he hit it three times. The oven then
toppled over, broke and collapsed of itself. Momentarily there
was a man in a blue robe and tall hat suddenly standing in front
of the Master; bowing, he said, "I am the god of the oven; for a
long time I have been subject to retribution for actions, but
today, hearing the Master explain the truth of non-origination,
I am already freed from this place, and living in heaven. I have
come especially to offer thanks." The Master said, "It is your
fundamentally inherent nature, not my forced saying so." The
god again bowed, and disappeared. An attendant said, "I and
others have been around the Master for a long time, but have
never received instruction. What shortcut did the oven god
find, that he was immediately born in heaven?" The Master
said, "I just said to him, 'You were originally made of brick and
mud put together; where does the spirit come from, whence
does the sanctity emerge?"' The attendant had no reply. The
Master said, "Do you understand?" The monk said, "I do not
understand." The Master said, "Bow!" The monk bowed; the
Master said, "Broken! Collapsed!" The attendant was suddenly
greatly enlightened.
Later a certain monk reported this to National Teacher Hui
An. The Teacher sighed in admiration and said, "This lad has
comprehended thoroughly things and self as one suchness."

Ninety-sixth Case

531

The oven god understood this principle, therefore he was
thus: that monk was a body composed of five heaps; (the Mas­
ter) also said, "Broken! Collapsed!" Both opened to enlighten­
ment, but tell me, are the four elements and five heaps the
same as or different from brick and tiles, mud and earth? Since
it is so, why does Hsueh Tau say, "The staff suddenly strikes;
(the oven god) then realizes he had turned away from his self"?
Why does one become turned away? It is just a matter of not
yet having found the staff.
And tell me, as Hsueh Tau eulogizes "a wood Buddha does
not pass through fire," why does he cite the public case of the
oven breaking and collapsing? I will explain it directly for you;
his intention is just to cut off feelings and ideas of gain and
loss; once cleaned and naked, you will naturally see his kind­
ness.

The Diamond Cutter Scripture's
Scornful Revilement

POINTER

If you take up one and let two go, you are not yet an adept; even
to understand three corners when one is raised still goes
against the fundamental essence. Even if you get heaven and
earth to change instantly, without rejoinder from the four
quarters, thunder rolling and lightning flying, clouds moving
and rain rushing, overturning lakes and toppling cliffs, like a
pitcher pouring, like a bowl emptying, you have still not raised
up a half. Is there anyone who can turn the polar star, who can
shift the axis of the earth? To test, I cite this to see.

CASE

The Diamond Cutter scripture says, "If one is scornfully re­
viled by others,1 this person has done wicked acts in previous
ages2 which should bring him down into evil ways,J but be­
cause of the scorn and vilification by others in the present age,4
the wicked action of former ages5 is thereby extinguished."6

COMMENTARY

In the Diamond Cutter scripture3 it says, "If one is scorned and
vilified by other people, the fact is that this person has done
evil actions in former ages which should bring him down into
evil ways; but because of the scornful revilement of people in
this age, the wicked action of former ages is thereby extin­
guished." According to the ordinary way of interpretation, this
is the constant theme throughout the scripture. Hsueh Tou
brings it up and versifies this meaning; he wants to break up
the scholastic schools' livelihood in the ghost caves. Prince
Chao Mingb singled out this part and considered it able to clear
away obstruction by former deeds.
The general idea of the scripture talks about the efficacy of
this scripture: someone like this in former times created hell­
ish deeds, but because of the strength of its good power, he has
not yet suffered. Because of scorn and vilification by people in
the present age, the wicked action of former ages is thereby
extinguished. This scripture therefore can extinguish the
wicked deeds of innumerable aeons, changing the grave to be­
come light, changing the light to being inconsequential, and
furthermore bringing the attainment of enlightenment, the
fruit of Buddhahood.
According to the scholastic schools, turningc this twenty­
odd page scripture is itself called "upholding the scripture,"
but what connection is there? Some say that the scripture itself
has spiritual power. If so, take a volume and lay it in an unclut­
tered place; see if there is any effect or not. Fa Yen said,
"Realizing Buddhahood is called 'upholding this scripture."' In
the scripture it says, "All the Buddhas and the teaching of
complete perfect awakening of all the Buddhas, all comes forth
from this scripture." But tell me, what do you call"this scrip­
ture"? Is it not that with yellow scrolls on red rollers? Don't
mistakenly stick by the zero point of the scale.
The Diamond is likened to the body of truth: because it is
hard and solid, things cannot break it; because of its sharp
cutting function, it can break anything. Apply it to a mountain,
and the mountain crumbles; apply it to the sea, and the sea
dries up. The name is expressed in metaphor, and so is its
activity.

534

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

This wisdom is of three kinds: the first is the wisdom of the
character of reality, the second is observant illumination wis­
dom, and the third is verbal wisdom. The wisdom of the
character of reality is true knowl�dge: it is the one great matter
where each of you stands, shining across past and present, far
beyond knowledge and opinion; it is that which is clean and
naked, bare and untrammelled. Observant illumination wis­
dom is the real world; it is that which emits light and moves
the earth twenty-four hours a day, hearing sound and seeing
form. Verbal wisdom is the language which can express it; that
is, the present speaker and hearer. But tell me, is this wisdom
or is it not wisdom? An Ancient said, "Everyone has a volume
of scripture." It has also been said, "My hand does not hold a
scripture scroll, but I am always turning such a scripture."
If you depend on this scripture's spiritual efficacy, why stop
at just making the serious trifling, and making the trifling to­
tally inconsequential? Even if you could match the ability of
the sages, that would still not be anything special.
Have you not seen how Layman P'ang, listening to an expo­
sition of the Diamond Cutter scripture, asked the lecturer, "A
layman dares to have a small question; is that all right?" The
lecturer said, "If you have a doubt, please ask." The layman
said, "'There is no sign of self, no sign of others'-since there is
no sign of self or others, who would you have lecture, who
would you have listen?" The lecturer had no reply; instead he
said, "I just interpret the meaning according to the letter; I do
not know the meaning of this." The layman then said in verse,

No self and no others; how could there be near or
far�
I urge you to stop going through lectures;
How could that be compared to seeking the real
directly�
The nature of adamantine wisdom is devoid of a
single particle of dust;
'I have heard' through 'I faithfully accept'
Are all just artificial names.
This verse is most excellent; it has clearly explained all at
once.
Kuei Feng picked out a four line stanza, saying, "Whatever is
seen, all is empty falsehood; if you see that various forms are

Ninety-seventh Case

535

not forms, then you see the Tathagata." The meaning of this
four line stanza is exactly the same as "Realizing Buddhahood
is called 'upholding this scripture.'"
It is also said (in the scripture), "If one sees me by means of
form, if he seeks me by means of sound, this person is travers­
ing a false path; he cannot see the Tathagata." This too is a four
line stanza; we just take from among them those whose mean­
ing is complete. A monk asked Hui T'ang, "What is the four
line stanza?" Hui T'ang said, "Your talk is degenerate, yet you
don't even realize it."
Hsueh Tou points out what is in this scripture. If there is
someone who can uphold this scripture, then this is the scen­
ery of everyone's original ground, the original face: but if you
act according to the Patriarchs' imperative, the scenery of the
original ground, the original face, would still be cut into three
pieces; the twelve-part teachings of the Buddhas of the three
times wouldn't be worth a pinch. At this point, even if you had
the ten thousand varieties of skill, you still couldn't handle
them. Nowadays people only revolve scriptures and do not
know what the principle is at all. They merely say, "In one day,
I have revolved so many." They only recognize the yellow
scrolls on red rollers, perusing the lines and counting the ink­
marks. They are far from realizing that it all arises from their
own original minds, that this is only a bit of a turning point.
Master Ta Chu said, "Pile up several cases of scriptures in an
empty room, and see if they emit light." It's just your own
mind, inspired in a single moment of thought, that is the vir­
ture. Why? Myriad things all come forth from one's own mind.
One moment of thought is aware; once aware, it pervades;
having pervaded, it transforms. An Ancient said, "The green
bamboos are all true thusness; the lush yellow flowers are all
wisdom." If you can see all the way through, then this is true
thusness; but if you have not yet seen, tell me, what do you call
true thusness? The Flower Garland scripture says, "If a person
wants to know all the Buddhas of past, present, and future, he
should observe that the nature of the cosmos is all just the
fabrication of mind." If you can discern, then in whatever situ­
ations or circumstances you meet, you'll be the master and the
source. If you cannot yet get it clear, then humbly listen to the
verdict: Hsueh Tou puts forth an eye and versifies the main
theme, wishing to clarify the scripture's spiritual efficacy.

COMMENTARY

"The clear jewel is in my palm; to whoever has accomplish­
ment, I'll reward it." If there is someone who can uphold this
scripture with actual effect, then he is rewarded with the jewel.
When he gets this jewel, he will naturally know how to use it:
when a foreigner comes, a foreigner is reflected; when a native
comes, a native is reflected-myriad forms and appearances,
vertically and horizontally, are clearly reflected. This is having
actual accomplishment. These two lines have finished versify­
ing the public case.

Ninety-seventh Case

53 7

"When neither foreigner nor native comes, it is utterly
without abilities." (Here) Hsueh Tou turns your nose around.
When foreigners or natives appear, then he has you reflect
them; if neither foreigner nor native comes, then what? When
he gets here, even the Buddha's eye cannot see in. But tell me,
is this accomplishment, or is it wicked action? Is he a for­
eigner? Is he a native? He's just like the antelope with his horns
hung up: do not say there is any sound or trace of him-there is
not even a breath; where could you go to search for him? He
has gotten to where there is no road on which to have the gods
offer flowers, no gate through which demons and outsiders
might secretly spy. That is why the Master of Tung Shan dwelt
all his life in the temple, but the earth spirit couldn't find any
trace of him. One day someone spilled rice flour in the kitchen;
Tung Shan aroused his mind and said, "How can you treat the
communal supplies with such contempt?" So the earth spirit
finally got to see him; thereupon he bowed.
Hsueh Tou says, "Since there are no abihties;" if you reach
the point where there is no ability, you will make even the Evil
One, the king of demons, lose the way. The World Honored
One regarded all sentient beings as his children: if there is one
person who rouses his mind to practice, the palace of the Evil
One would tremble and split because of this, and the demons
would come to torment and confuse the practitioner. Hsueh
Tou says that even if the Evil One comes like this, still one
must make him lose his way and have no avenue of approach.
Hsueh Tou goes on to point to himself and say, "Gautama,
Gautama! I Do you know me or not?" Do not even speak of
demons; even should the Buddha come, would he know me or
not? Even old Shakyamuni himself couldn't see him; where
will you people search for him? He also said, "Completely
exposed." But tell me, is this Hsueh Tou exposing Gautama, or
is it Gautama exposing Hsueh Tou? Those who have eyes, try
to see for sure.

"Turning" or "revolving" means recitation; usually, in the case of
long scriptures, it means reciting snatches of the scripture while
skipping rapidly through. Mahasattva Fu invented a revolving

at once by this device; usually memorized passages of scripture
are recited while turning the whole canon.

COMMENTARY

Master Ts'ung Yi of T'ien P'ing, travelling on foot, went to see
Hsi Yuan. Ssu Ming of Hsi Yuan had first called on Ta Hsueh,
and later succeeded to the former Pao Shou. One day he asked,
"How is it after trampling down the Temporary Citadel of

Ninety-eighth Case

541

nirvanat" Shou said, "A sharp sword does not cut a dead man."

Ming said, "Cut!" Shou thereupon hit him. Ssu Ming said
"Cut!" ten times, and Shou hit him ten times and said, "What
is this fellow's big hurry to take this dead corpse and submit it
to ano ther's painful staff?" Finally he shouted and drove Ssu
Ming out. At that time there was a monk who asked Pao Shou,
"That monk who just asked a question is quite reasonable,
Master; deal with him appropriately." Pao Shou hit him too,
driving out this monk. But tell me, when Pao Shou also drove
out this monk, can you say it was just because he was speaking
of right and wrong, or is there another reason? What was his
idea? Later they both succeeded to Pao Shou.
Ssu Ming one day went to see Nan Yuan. Yuan asked him,
"Where do you come from?" Ming said, "From Hsu Chou."
Yuan said, "What did you bring?" Ming said, "I brought a razor
from Kiangsi; I offer it to you." Yuan said, "Since you come
from Hsu Chou, how is it that you have a razor from Kiangsi?"
Ming took Yuan's hand and pinched it once. Yuan said, "At­
tendant! Take him a way!" Ssu Ming gave a whisk of his sleeve
and left. Yuan said, "0 wow!"
T'ien P'ing had once called on the Master of Chin Shan.
Because he had gone to various places and attained this
tumip-Ch'an and put it in his belly, everywhere he went he
scornfully opened his big mouth and said, "I understand Ch'an,
I understand the Way." He always said, "Do not say you under­

stand the Buddhist Teaching; I cannot find even a single man
who can quote a saying." His stinking breath affected others,
and he only indulged in scorn and contempt.
Before the Buddha had appeared in the world, before the
Patriarch had come from the West, before there were questions
and answers, before there were public cases, was there any
Ch'an Way? The Ancients could not avoid imparting teachings
according to potentialities; people later called them "public
cases." As the World Honored One raised a flower, Kasyapa
smiled; later on, Ananda asked Kasyapa, "The World Honored
One handed on his golden-sleeved robe; what special teaching
did he transmit to you besides?" Kasyapa said, "Ananda!"
Ananda responded; Kasyapa said, "Take down the flagpole in
front of the monastery gate." But before the flower was raised,
before Ananda had asked, where do you find any public cases?
You just accept the winter melon seals of various places, and

542

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

once the seal is set, you then immediately say, "I understand
the marvel of the Buddhist Teaching! Don't let anyone know!"
T'ien P'ing was just like this: when Hsi Yuan called him to
come and then said, "Wrong!" twice in a row, right away he
was confused and bewildered, unable to give any explanations;
he "neither got to the village nor reached the shop." Some say
that to speak of the meaning of the coming from the West is
already wrong; they are far from knowing what these two
wrongs of Hsi Yuan ultimately come down to. You people tell
me, what do they come down to? This is why it is said, "He
studies the living word, not the dead word." When T'ien P'ing
raised his head, he had already fallen into two and three. Hsi
Yuan said, "Wrong." But (T'ien P'ing) did not grasp his
straightforward action, but just said, "I have a bellyful of
Ch'an," and didn't pay any attention to him, and went two or
three steps. Hsi Yuan again said, "Wrong!" But T'ien P'ing was
as muddled as before, and approached Hsi Yuan. Yuan said,
"The two wrongs just now; were they my wrongs or your
wrongs?" T'ien P'ing said, "My wrongs." Fortunately, there is
no connection. Already he had fallen into seventh and eighth
place. Hsi Yuan said, "Just stay here for the summer and wait
for me to discuss these two wrongs with you." T'ien P'ing
immediately went away. He seemed to be right, but wasn't
really. Then again, I don't say he wasn't right; it's just that he
couldn't catch up. Nevertheless, he still had something of the
air of a patchrobed monk.
When T'ien P'ing later was dwelling in a temple, he said to
his community, "When I was first travelling on foot, I was
blown by the wind of events to Master Ssu Ming's place. Twice
he said 'Wrong!' and tried to have me pass the summer there to
wait for him to deliberate with me. I did not say it was wrong
then; when I set out for the South, I already knew that it was
wrong." This old fellow has said quite a bit; it's just that he's
fallen into seventh and eighth place, shaking his head thinking,
out of touch. When people these days hear him saying, "When I
set out for the South, I already knew that it was wrong," they
immediately go figuring it out and say, "Before even going on
foot travels, there is naturally not so much Buddhism or Ch'an;
and when you go foot travelling, you are completely fooled by
people everywhere. Even before foot travels, you can't call
earth sky or call mountains rivers; fortunately there is nothing

Ninety-eighth Case

543

to be concerned about at all." If you all entertain such common
vulgar views, why not buy a bandanna to wear and pass your
time in the boss's house? What is the use? Buddha's teaching is
not this principle. If you discuss this matter, how could there
be so many complications? If you say, "I understand, others do
not understand," carrying a bundle of Ch'an around the coun­
try, when you are tried out by clear-eyed people, you won't be
able to use it at all. Hsueh Tau versifies in exactly this way:
VERSE

Followers of the Ch'an house

The lacquer buckets all have their crimes listed on the
same indictment.
Like to be scornful.·

Still there are some (who are otherwise). Those who scold
Buddhas and revile Patriarchs are as plentiful as hemp and
millet.
Having studied till their bellies are full, they cannot put it to
use.
It would be best to have use. A square peg does not fit in a

round hole. You are a fellow student of theirs.
How lamentable, laughable old T'ien P'ing;
No patchrobed monk in the world can leap out. He

doesn't fear that bystanders may frown. Still he's gotten
people to foolishly fret.
After all he says at the outset it was regrettable to go travel on
foot.
He was already wrong before he had gone travelling.

Wearing out sandals, what is the use? He blots it out with
one brush stroke.
Wrong, wrong!

What is this? Hsueh Tau has already wrongly named it.
Hsi Yuan's pure wind suddenly melts him.

Where is Hsi Yuan? What is it like? Do not speak only of
Hsi Yuan; even the Buddhas of past, present, and future
and the old masters everywhere also must fall back three
thousand miles. If you can understand here, you may
travel freely anywhere.

COMMENTARY

"Followers of the Ch'an house like to be scornful; having
studied till their bellies are full, they can't put it to use." This
fellow understood, as far as understanding goes; it's just that he
couldn't use it. He always gazed at the cloudy sky and said he
understood so much Ch'an; but when he was heated a little in
the fireplace, it turned out that he couldn't use it at all. My late
Master Wu Tsu said, "There is a kind of person who studies
Ch'an like stuffing cakes in a crystal pitcher; it can't be turned
over any more, it can't be cleaned out, and if you bump it, it
immediately breaks. If you want to be lively and active, just
study 'leather bag' Ch'an: even if you smash it down from the
highest mountain, it still won't break, it won't burst." An An­
cient said, "Even if you can grasp it before it is spoken, this is
still remaining in the shell, wandering within limitation; even
if you can thoroughly penetrate upon hearing a phrase, you still
won't avoid crazy views on the way."
"How lamentable, laughable old T'ien P'ing; after all he says
it was regrettable at the outset to go travelling." Hsueh Tau is
saying that it's lamentable that he couldn't explain to others;
it's laughable that he understood a bellyful of Ch'an but
couldn't go on to make even the slightest use of it. "Wrong,
wrong!" Some say that T'ien P'ing didn't understand, and thus
was wrong; and some say his not speaking was wrong. But
what connection is there? They hardly realize that these two
"wrong"s are like stone struck sparks, like flashing lightning;

this is where those transcendent people tread, like using a
sword to kill people, immediately grabbing people's throats,
whereupon their root of life is severed. If you can travel on the
sword's edge, then you will be free in all ways. If you can
understand these two "wrong"s, then you can thereby see Hsi
Yuan's pure wind suddenly melting (T'ien P'ing). When Hsueh
Tou had finished quoting this story in the hall, he meant to say
"wrong." I ask you, how does this wrong of Hsueh Tou com­
pare to T'ien P'ing's wrong? Study for thirty more years.

COMMENTARY

When the Emperor Su Tsung was living in the Eastern Palace
(as crown prince) he was already studying under National
Teacher Chung. Later, when he succeeded to the throne, he
honored him even more earnestly; when (Chung) came and
went, (Su Tsung) greeted and saw him off, personally bearing
the palanquin.
One day he posed a question to ask the National Teacher,
"What is the Ten-Body Controller?" The Teacher said, "Pa­
tron, walk on Vairocana's head." The National Teacher's spine
was usually as stiff as cast iron; but when he came into the
presence of the emperor, it was like soft mud. Although he
answered subtly, still he had a good point. He said, "If you
want to understand, Patron, you must walk on Vairocana's
head before you can understand." The emperor didn't get it; he
said, "I don't understand." The National Teacher was sub­
sequently extremely indulgent and entered into the weeds; he
further commented on the preceding phrase by saying, "Do not
mistakenly acknowledge your own pure body of reality." That
refers to what is inherent in everyone, complete and perfect in
each and every one. See how (Chung) lets go and gathers in,
taking on adversaries from all sides.
Have you not heard it said that one who is good as a teacher
sets up the teaching according to potential? He observes the
wind to set the sail; if he just stayed in one comer, how could
he interchange? Observe the Elder of Huang Po; he was well
able to guide people; when he met Lin Chi, in three times he
hit him sixty painful blows, and Lin Chi thereupon under­
stood. But when he came to helping Prime Minister P'ei Hsiu,
it was complicated in the extreme.c Was he not good as a
teacher of people? National Teacher Chung skillfully used ap­
propriate methods to teach Emperor Su Tsung; in all it was
because he had the skill to take on adversaries from all sides.
The "Ten-Body Controller" is the ten kinds of other-experi­
enced body.d The three bodies of Reality ( dharmakaya), En­
joyment (sambhogakaya), and Appearance (nirmanakaya), are
identical to the body of reality. Why? Because the enjoyment
and appearance are not the real Buddha, and they are not what
expounds the Dharma. When remaining in the body of reality,

548

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

then as a single expanse of empty solidity, spiritual brightness
quiescently shines.
When the Elder Fu of T'ai Yuan was expounding the Nir­
vana

scripture in Kuang Hsiao Temple of Yang Chou, there

was a wandering monk-actually it was the cook of Chia
Shan-who was staying in the temple, snowed in; he took the
opportunity to go listen to the lecture. When the lecture
touched on the three bases of Buddha naturee and the three
qualities of the body of reality/ and as Fu spoke profusely of the
subtle principle of the body of reality, the cook suddenly broke
out laughing. Fu then looked at him. When the lecture was
over, he had someone summon the Ch'an man, and asked him,
11My simple knowledge is narrow and inferior; I interpret the
meanings according to the words. Just now, in the course of the
lecture, I saw you break out in a laugh; I must have some
shortcoming-please explain it to me."
The cook said, "If you did not ask, I dare not speak. Since
you have asked, I cannot but explain. I was actually laughing
because you don't know the body of reality." Fu said, 11What is
wrong with my explanation, such as it was?" The cook said,
"Please explain it once more." Fu said, "The principle of the
body of reality is like the great void: vertically, it goes through
past, present, and future; horizontally it extends throughout
the ten directions of the universe; it fills the eight extremities
and embraces both positive and negative modes. According to
conditions, it tends toward effect; there is nowhere it does not
extend." The cook said, "I did not say your explanation is
wrong; but you only know that which pertains to the extent of
the body of reality; you do not actually know the body of real­
ity." Fu said, "Granting that you are right, you should explain
it for me." The cook said, "If you agree, then give up lecturing
for ten days, and meditate correctly in a quiet room; collect
your mind, gather your thoughts, give up various clingings to
good and bad all at once, and investigate exhaustively on your
own."
Fu did just as he had said, from the first to the fifth watch of
the night; when he heard the sounding of the drum, he sud­
denly attained enlightenment and immediately went to knock
on the Ch'an man's door. The cook said, "Who's there?" Fu
said, "Me." The cook scolded him, saying "I would have you
transmit and maintain the Great Teaching, explaining it in the

Ninety-ninth Case

549

Buddha's steadi why are you laying in the street drunk on wine
in the middle of the night?" Fu said, "Hitherto in my lectures
on the scriptures I have been twisting the nostrils of the father
and mother who gave birth to mei from today on, I no longer
dare to be like this."
See that outstanding fellow! Did he merely go accept this
radiant spirituality and fall in front of asses but behind horses?
He had to have broken up his habitual active consciousness, so
that there is nothing that can be apprehendedi yet he has still
only realized one half. An Ancient said, "If you do not give rise
to any thought of practice or study, within formless light you'll
always be free." Just discern that which is always silent and
stilli do not acknowledge sound and formi just discern spiritual
knowledge, do not acknowledge false imagination. This is why
it was said, "Even if an iron wheel is turning on your head,
with concentration and wisdom complete and clear, they are
never lost."
Bodhidharma asked the Second Patriarch, "What did you cut
your arm off for, standing there in the snow?" The Patriarch
said, "My mind is not yet at easei please ease my mind for me,
Master." Bodhidharma said, "Bring me your mind and I'll ease
it for you." The Patriarch said, "When I seek my mind, after all
I can't find it." Bodhidharma said, "I have eased your mind for
you." The Second Patriarch suddenly attained enlightenment.
But tell me, at just such a moment, where is the body of real­
ity? Ch'ang Sha said,
Students of the Way do not know reality
Just because they acknowledge the conscious spirit
as before;
It's the root of countless aeons of birth and death,
Yet fools call it the original man.

People right now just acknowledge this radiant awareness, and
immediately stare and glare, playing with their spirits: but
what relevance does this have? As he said, "Do not acknowl­
edge your own pure body of reality," but when it comes to your
own body of reality, you have still not even seen it in a dreami
how can you yet talk about not acknowledging it? In the doc­
trinal schools, they consider the pure body of reality to be the
ultimate lawi why not let people acknowledge it? Haven't you
heard it said, "As long as you are acknowledging it, as before it

550

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

is after all still not so." Bah! It's best to immediately strike a
blow. Whoever can understand the meaning of this will for the
first time understand his saying, "Don't acknowledge your
own pure body of reality." Hsueh Tou dislikes his indulgent
kindness, but nevertheless there are thorns in the soft mud.
Have you not seen how Master Tung Shan had three roads
for teaching people? They were called the "Hidden Road," the
"Bird's Path," and "Extending the Hands." Beginners in the
study of the Way temporarily travelled the three roads. A monk
asked the Master, "You always teach students to travel the
Bird's Path: what is the Bird's Path like?" Tung Shan said,
"You don't meet anyone." The monk asked, "How can I travel
it?" Shan said, "There just should not be a single thread under
your feet as you go."g The monk said, "If I travel the Bird's
Path, is this not my Original Face?" Shan said, "Why are you
upside down?" The monk said, "How am I upside down?"
Shan said, "If you are not upside down, why do you take the
servant to be the master?" The monk said, "What is the Origi­
nal Face?" Shan said, "It does not travel the Bird's Path."
You must see as far as this realmi only then will you have a
little realization. Even if you cleaned everything and made
yourself cut off your tracks and swallow your voice, still in the
school of the patchrobed monks this is still the view of novices
and children. You must still tum your heads around to the
troubles of the world and fully arouse your great function.

VERSE

"The Teacher of a Nation" is also a forced name;

What is the necessity? A flower in the skyi the moon in
the water. When the wind passes over, the treetops move.
Nan Yang alone may flaunt his good fame:

After all he cuts off the essential bridge. Among a
thousand or ten thousand, it's hard to find one or a half.
In Great T'ang he helped a real son of heaven-

Pitiful. What is the use of teaching him?What is ac­
complished by teaching a blind patchrobed monk?
Once he had him tread upon Vairocana's head.

Why doesn't everybody go like this? They would find
heaven and earth. How would you tread?

Ninety-ninth Case

551

Then his iron hammer struck and shattered the golden bones;
He's happy in everyday life. It's already thus before saying

so.
Between heaven and earth, what more is there?
Within the fast and boundless four oceans, there are few

who know. The whole body bears the load. He is scatter­
ing sand and dirt.
The lands and seas of three thousand worlds by night are still
and silent;
Set your eyes high. Hold fast to your territory; are you

waiting to enter a ghost cave?
I do not know who enters the Blue Dragon's cave.

Thirty blows of the staff; not one can be omitted. He's
finished bringing it up, but do you understand? Bah!
People, your nostrils have been pierced by Hsueh Tou. Do
not mistakenly acknowledge your own pure body of real­
ity.

COMMENTARY

"The Teacher of a Nation is also a forced name; I Nan Yang
alone may flaunt his good fame." This verse is just like a eu­
logy on a portrait. Haven't you heard it said that the ultimate
man has no name? To call him National Teacher is also a case
of having forcibly affixed a name. The Way of the National
Teacher is incomparable. He was skillfully able to teach others
in this way.
Nan Yang alone may be accepted as a Master: "In Great
T'ang he helped a true son of heaven, and once had him tread
upon Vairocana's head." If you have the eye and brain of a
patchrobed monk who possesses the eye, you must walk upon
Vairocana's head, and only then will you see this Ten-Body
Controller. A Buddha is called the "Controller"; this is one of
his ten epithets.h One body transforms into ten bodies, ten
bodies transform into a hundred bodies, and so on, to a
thousand hundred hundred million bodies; in their totality
they are just one body. This one verse is easy to explain; the
latter versifies that saying, "Do not acknowledge your pure

552

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

body of reality," and versifies in sucha way that water poured
on cannot wet it; it is difficult to explain.
"His iron hammer strikes, smashing the golden bones."
This versifies "Do not acknowledge your own pure body of
reality." Hsueh Tou praises (Chung) greatly; the golden bones
have been smashed by one blow of his mallet. "Between
heaven and earth, what more is there?" It is just necessary to
be clean and naked, bare and untrammelled, so there is no
longer anything to be apprehended; then this is the scenery of
the basic ground. It is just like the lands and seas of three
thousand worlds still and silent in the night. In a universe of
three thousand great world systems, in the midst of the Sea of
Fragrant Waters, there are infinite lands; in each land there is
an ocean. Just when the night is deep and still, and heaven and
earth are at once clear and calm, tell me, what is this? Just
don't make an understanding of closing your eyes. If you un­
derstand in this way, then you'll fall into the poisonous sea.
"I don't know who enters the Blue Dragon's cave." Stretch­
ing out the legs, folding the legs; tell me, who is this? Every­
body's nostrils have been pierced by Hsueh Tou all at once.

TRANSLATORS 1 NOTES

a.

"Gold" means an instrument made of metal; "jade," an instru­
ment of stone: ancient Chinese music began with "gold" and
ended with "jade"-hence "gold and jade" refers to "consumma­
tion." Also they are used to indicate excellence, so we translate
literally.

b.

This refers to two master archers shooting at each other; their
skill is equal, so their arrows meet each other midway and stop.
This story is originally from the

Lieh-tzu, a Taoist classic; there is
Ts'an T'ung Ch'i which

also the famous passage in Shih T'ou's

says, "Phenomena's existence is like box and cover joining; prin­
ciples' correspondence is like arrowpoints meeting."

This refers to the

d.

A Buddha is said to have two kinds of real body

( dharmakaya);

that experienced by himself, and that experienced by others. The

553

former is his own enlightenment, and the latter is his teaching of
others, or how others experience the Buddha in their perceptions
of his qualities and teachings. According to the Hua Yen, or
Flower Garland scripture, there are the Buddha of nonattachment,
the Buddha of vows, the Buddha of results of action, the Buddha of
abiding maintenance, the Buddha of extinction (nirvana), the
Buddha of the cosmos (the dharmadhatu, or ultimate realm), the
Buddha of mind, the Buddha of concentration, the Buddha of na­
ture, and the magical Buddha. Vairocana, the Great Illuminator,
also called the Great Sun Buddha in Chinese, is the primordial
Buddha, representing the body of reality, the basis and totality of
all these.
e.

The three bases of Buddha nature are the true basis, the basis of
understanding, and the basis of conditions. The true basis is the
real nature which underlies Buddhahood, the Buddha nature in­
herent in everyone; the basis of understanding is wisdom, which
realizes this real nature; the basis of conditions is the practices
which unfold wisdom and allow one to realize one's Buddha na­
ture.

f.

The three qualities of the body of reality correspond to the three
bases of Buddha nature; the quality of the pure body of reality,
which corresponds to the true basis, the quality of wisdom, which
corresponds to the basis of understanding, and the quality of lib­
eration, which corresponds to the basis of conditions, cultivation
of liberating practices.

Even the most ancient texts give an alternative reading which is
homonymous; "Nothing private under your feet." For an explana­

The ten epithets of a Buddha are, Realized One (Tathagata),
Worthy (Arhat), True and Universal Knower, Perfect in Knowl­

excelled Knight, Controller of Humanity, Teacher of Humans and
Gods, Enlightened One (Buddha), World Honored One. The trans­
lations given here are based on Chinese; the Sanskrit equivalents

PaLing's Blown Hair Sword

POINTER

All summer I've been verbosely making up complications, and
almost entangled and tripped up all the monks in the land. But
when the Diamond Sword cuts directly, I first realize my
hundred-fold incompetence. But tell me, what is the Diamond
Sword like? Open your eyes and I'll reveal the swordpoint for
you to see.

CASE

A monk asked Pa Ling, "What is the Blown Hair Sword? "1a
Pa Ling said, "Each branch of coral supports the moon."2

NOTES

1.

Cut! Dangerous!

2.

The light engulfs myriad forms, the entire land.

COMMENTARY

Pa Ling does not move his shield and spear, (but) in the land,
how many people's tongues fall to the ground! Yun Men taught
people just like this; (PaLing) was a true son of Yun Men. And
each of (Yun Men's successors) had his strategy of action; that
is why (Hsueh Tou) said, "I always admire Shao Yang's newly
established devices; all his life he pulled out nails and drew out
pegs for people."
This story is just like this; within one phrase there are three
phrases naturally inherent-the phrase enclosing heaven and
earth, the phrase cutting off all streams, and the phrase follow­
ing the waves. His reply was undeniably outstanding. Yuan

554

Hundredth Case

555

"the jurist" of Fu Shan said, "For a man who has not yet passed
through, studying the meaning is not as good as studying the
phrase." At Yun Men's place there were three venerable adepts
who replied about the "Blown Hair Sword"; two of them said,
"Complete." Only PaLing was able to give an answer beyond
the word "complete"-this is attaining the phrase.
But tell me, are "complete" and "each branch of coral sup­
ports the moon" the same or different? Before, (Hsueh Tou)
said, "The three phrases should be distinguished; one arrow
flies through space." If you want to understand this story, you
must cut off the defilement of feelings and conscious concep­
tions, and be completely purified; then you will see his saying,
"Each branch of coral supports the moon." If you make up any
further rationalization, all the more you'll find you're unable to
grasp it.
These words are from Ch'an Yueh's poem of remembering a
friend:
Thick as the iron on the Iron Closure Mountains,
Thin as the dapples on the body of immortal Shuang
Cheng.
Pheonixes and fowl from the looms of Shu always
make him stumble.
Each branch of coral supports the moon;
Stored away in the house of Wang K'ai, it is hard to
dig out.
Yen Hui, that hungry fellow, laments the sky's
snow;
The ancient cypress brush is so straight, even snow
can't break it.
The snow-clad stone girl's curling peach belt­
Wearing it, he enters the dragon palace, his steps
slow.
The embroidered screen, the silver ladle; how do
they differ!
The jet black dragon has lost the jewel; do you
know it or not!

PaLing took one phrase from among these lines to reply to the
"Blown Hair Sword"; he is quick. One blows a hair against the
edge of a sword to test it; when the hair splits of itself, then it is
a sharp sword, and it is called a blown hair sword. PaLing just

556

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

goes to the point of his question and immediately answers this
monk's words. (The monk's) head fell without him even realiz­
ing it.

VERSE

When it is necessary to even the uneven,

Tiny as an ant. A powerful man should be like this.
Even the great adept seems inept.
He does not stir sound or form. He hides his body but

reveals his shadow.
Sometimes on the finger, sometimes in the palm;

Look! After all this is not it.
Leaning against the sky, it shines on the snow­

Cut! If you stare at it, you'll go blind.
Even a great smith cannot hone it;

What do you still want to forget it for? Even Kan Chiang
(the legendary smith) couldn't find it.
Even a master craftsman wouldn't finish polishing it.
No one could do it. Even if Kan Chiang came forth, he too

would fall back.
It is exceptional, unique:

Bah! What is so special about it? (Yet) there is something
praiseworthy about it.
Each branch of coral supports the moon.

In the third watch the moon descends, its image shining

in the cold pond. Tell me, where does it go? Drunk and
doddering, he saddens others to death.

COMMENTARY

"When it is necessary to even the uneven, the great adept
seems inept." In the past there were wandering warriors; on
their way when they saw inequity where the strong oppressed
the weak, then they would let fly with their swords to take the
heads of the strong. Thus, masters of our school hide a jewel

Hundredth Case

557

sword in their eyebrows, and hang a golden mallet in their
sleeves, whereby to settle matters of unrest. "The great adept
seems inept"-Pa Ling's answer was intended to even what
was uneven; because his words were exceeding skillful, instead
they turn out to seem inept. What is the reason? Because he
does not come attack directly: instead he goes off into a corner
and with one stroke secretly beheads the man, yet the man is
not aware of it.
"Sometimes on the finger, sometimes in the palm; I Leaning
against the sky, it shines on the snow." If you can understand,
then it is like the cold and severe spiritual grandeur of a long
sword leaning against the sky. An Ancient said, "The mind
moon solitary and full, its light engulfs myriad forms. The light
is not shining on objects, and the objects are not existing,
either. Light and objects both forgotten, then what is this?"
This jewel sword is sometimes manifest on the fingertip; sud­
denly it appears in the palm. In the old days when Librarian
Ch'ing had reached this point in his explanation, he raised his
hand and said, "Do you see?" Still, it's not necessarily in the
hand or the finger: Hsueh Tau just takes a shortcut to let you
see the Ancient's meaning. But say, every place cannot but be
the Blown Hair Sword; that is why it is said, "When the waves
are high at the triple gate, the fish turn to dragons; yet foolish
people still drag the evening pond water."
Hsueh Tau says this sword can lean against the sky and
shine upon the snow. Usually it is said that the light of the long
sword leaning against the sky can shine on the snow: this little
bit of function is such that even a great smith cannot hone it,
even a master craftsman could never finish polishing it. The
master craftsman is such as Nan Chiang (the legendary expert
smith): the old tale is self-evident.b
When Hsueh Tau has finished the verse, in the end he re­
veals (the sword), saying, "Exceptional, unique!" It is undeni­
ably exceptional, and has special excellence; it is not like an
ordinary sword. But tell me, how is it special? "Each branch of
coral supports the moon." This can be said to be prior to light
and after annihilation, occupying the heartland alone, without
any peer.
Ultimately, how is it? People, your heads are fallen. I have
one more little verse:

TRANSLATORS' NOTES

a.

As usual, the sword symbolizes wisdom, cutting off confusion
and attachment; uncontrived and equanimous, it sees the moon
of truth everywhere in everything.

b.

There is a story inserted in the text about Kan Chiang, the legen­
dary smith, and how he made the famous sword No Yeh. All
commentaries reject it as a later addition, and it serves no purpose
except to identify the name of Kan Chiang.

Biographical Supplement

The following excerpts from the lives and sayings of the emi­
nent Ch'an masters appearing in the main cases of The Blue
Cliff Record are taken mostly from the classic Ch'an history
Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu (briefly, Ch'uan Teng Lu, hereafter

referred to as CTL), the "Record of the Transmission of the
Lamp (compiled in) the Ching Te era (of the Sung dynasty,

1004)." Containing information on over six hundred Ch'an
masters, the CTL usually gives only a few bare biographical
facts such as birth, death, and enlightenment stories; most
"biography" consists of dialogues, sayings and doings of the
teachers. The CTL also includes three chapters of sermons,
poems, and short writings. It is a standard Ch'an book and a
primary source of many kung an.
Some material is also taken from the Tsu T'ang Chi, "Col­
lection from the Halls of the Ancestors"; Wu Teng Hui Yuan,
"Five Lamps Merged in the Source"; and Ku Tsun Su Yu Lu,
"Records of Sayings of Ancient Venerable Adepts." (These will
hereafter be referred to as TTC, WT, and KTS, respectively.)
The TTC antedates the CTL by about fifty years; though a
much smaller collection, it contains a number of stories not
found in CTL or later collections. The WT, a later and more
extensive compilation, draws on five so-called "Lamp" records,
including the CTL and its continuation, plus the Kuang Teng
Lu, Lien Teng Hui Yao, and P'u Teng Lu. The title "Five

Lamps" refers to these five source collections, but is also some­
times taken to refer to the five houses of classical Ch'an. The
WT covers a longer period of time than CTL, and often con­
tains more material on individual masters than does the
former. Tenkei Denson, one of the main commentators con­
sulted on The Blue Cliff Record, usually cites the WT as most
detailed and authoritative.
The KTS contains extensive records of sermons and sayings
of numerous Ch'an masters, and includes whole volumes
which have been published as individual books, such as the Lin

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

BODHIDHARMA
CASE

1

(4-6

cent.

A.D.)

Bodhidharma was a meditation master from southern India; by
the time of The Blue Cliff Record his life was veiled in legend.
Regarded as the first patriarch of Ch'an in China, most stories
of Bodhidharma popular in Ch'an circles are what may be
called illustrative history, and are used as teaching materials or
guides to contemplation.
Bodhidharma did not associate with kings, did not translate
any scriptures or found any temples, and transmitted his be­
quest to only a few successors. Though his immediate impact
on the Buddhist world in China was not very great, he was
influential enough locally to be opposed and assassinated. Al­
though there were many meditation teachers in China in
Bodhidharma's time, the Buddhist historian Tao Hsuan (7th
century A.D. ) wrote that Bodhidharma was one of only two
teachers who founded continuous transmission lines.
Bodhidharma claimed to be over one hundred and fifty years
old when he died. Many stories are told of him: popular legend
has it, for example, that his legs fell off after sitting still for
nine years; that tea plants first grew from his eyelids, which he
cut off in anger after falling asleep during his nine year vigil;
and that he introduced kung-fu combat techniques to the
monks in Shao Lin monastery, to bridle aggressive tendencies
and tone otherwise inactive bodies.
Bodhidharma's meeting with Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502549) may be part of the legend which grew up around the great
teacher. In his youth Wu had mastered many branches of learn­
ing, and in 498 was appointed Inspector of Ying Chou (in Hu­
nan); he later took advantage of internal disputes over the au­
thority of the Ch'i dynasty, his employer, to rebel and set up
his own kingdom in southern China, called Liang. Turning
from warfare to culture, Wu lavishly patronized Confucianism,
Taoism, and especially Buddhism, hiding from the respon­
sibilities of sovereignty under the cloak of personal piety.
Bodhidharma's blunt deflation of Emperor Wu's pretensions to
sanctity and merit is emblematic of the independence of the
Ch'an school; because Wu was deceived by outward forms and
the concept of holiness, it is said that he did not understand
Bodhidharma.

PAO CHIH
CASES

(417/421-514)

1, 67

Pao Chih is recognized as a master of Ch'an; thus he is said to
have "seen" Bodhidharma even though the two never met.*
The Chuan Teng Lu (27) says,
"Meditation master Pao Chih was a man from Chin Ling
(the area of Nanking, the southern capital). His surname was
Shu. As a youth he left home and stayed in Tao Lin monastery
and cultivated meditative concentration.
"In the beginning of the T'ai Shih era of Sung

(465-472),

suddenly he no longer dwelt in any fixed abode. He ate and
drank without consideration of the hour of the day. His hair
was several inches long. He walked barefoot, holding a staff;
the staff was armed with dagger, scissors, and a mirror."
Scissors are a conventional Chinese metaphor for appoint­
ment and dismissal, promotion and demotion; a mirror is a
Buddhist

metaphor

for

clear

awareness

without

biased

views-like a mirror that reflects anything that comes before
it. The record continues:
"Sometimes he wore one or two feet of silk. Even when not
eating for several days, he had no appearance of hunger. Some­
times he might sing songs; his words seemed to be prophecies.
The gentry and peasants alike did things for him.
"During the Yung Ming era of Ch'i, the Martial Emperor (r.

483-493) declared that the master was deluding the masses;

so

he had him captured and bound over to the prison at Chien
K'ang.
"When it was morning, the people saw him going into the
market place; but when an investigation was made, they found
him in prison as before. The prefect of Chien K'ang reported
the matter to the Emperor, who invited the master to dwell in
the rear hall within the palace.
"The master stayed at the Flower Forest Manor. Suddenly
one day he put on three cloth caps: it was not known where he
had gotten them. All of a sudden the Prince of Yu Ch'ang, Wen
Hui, and the Crown Prince died in succession. The Ch'i
dynasty too was now at its last. Due to this, they imprisoned
the master.
"When the Exalted Ancestor of Liang (the Emperor Wu of ex.
I) assumed that rank, he sent down an imperial rescript stating,

564

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

'Master Chih's tracks are within the province of the defile­
ments of the Dusts, but his spirit wanders in hidden tranquil­
ity. Water or fire could not burn or wet him; snakes or tigers
could not bother him or cause him fear. To speak of his en­
lightenment into the Principle, he is higher than a disciple of
Buddha; to talk about his mysterious obscurity, he is a lofty
one among the Escaped Immortals. How could we regulate him
according to the empty forms of the ordinary feelings of unini­
tiated people? Henceforth do not censor him again.' "
A few cryptic answers to imperial questions are attributed to
Pao Chih; they are recorded along with the interpretations of
"those who knew" among the court. In this case, his recogni­
tion of Bodhidharma as the bodhisattva of compassion is sym­
bolic of the eye of the source.
"In the winter of 514, when his life was about to end, he
suddenly ordered the community to move the temple's statue
of the Adamantine Being and place it outside. And he said
privately to people, 'A bodhisattva is about to leave.'
"Before ten days had passed he died without illness."
*It was believed that Bodhidharma came to China around 520-after
Pao Chih had already died; internal evidence in Hsu Kao Seng Chuan
suggests that Bodhidharma arrived in China during the latter part of
the Liu Sung dynasty (420-479) and was already in northern China
well before the end of the fifth century.

TS'UNG SHEN of Chao Chou (778-897)
CASES

2, 9, 30

Known as Chao Chou, after the place in northern China where
he lived and taught for the last forty years of his long life,
Ts'ung Shen was one of the most famous and revered Ch'an
masters of all time. He claimed to have seen over eighty of Ma
Tsu's successors during his long travels on foot; it was Nan
Ch'uan to whom he succeeded.
One day Chao Chou asked Nan Ch'uan, "What is the Way?"
Nan Ch'uan said, "The ordinary mind is the Way."
Chou said, "Is it still possible to aim for it?"
Ch'uan said, "If you attempt to turn towards it, then you are
turning away from it."

Biographies

565

Chou said, "When I make no attempt, how do I know this is
the Way?"
Ch'uan said, "The Way is not in the realm of knowing or not
knowing; knowing is false consciousness, and not knowing is
insensibility. If it is true arrival on the Way where there is no
doubt, it is like the great void, like a vacant hall, empty and
open; how could one insist on affirming or denying it?"
At these words Chao Chou awakened to the Way. After Nan
Ch'uan's death Chao Chou resumed his travels for over twenty
years more; only at the age of eighty did he settle down at the
Kuan Yin Temple in Chao Chou, where he taught until his
death at the age of one hundred and twenty.
Chao Chou was also known for his asceticism: "It was the
Master's will to emulate the ancients, and his abbacy was aus­
tere. In the monks' hall there were no shelves in front or rear.
Vegetarian food was prepared. When one leg of his rope chair
broke, he tied on a leftover piece of firewood with rope to
support it. There were repeated requests to make a new leg for
it, but the Master would not allow it." (This and subsequent
citations are taken from the record of Chao Chou's sayings in
Ku Tsun Su Yu Lu 13-14.)
As abbot, Chao Chou upheld the custom of universal labor
in the community of monks, a practice of the Ch'an school
initiated by the Fourth Patriarch Tao Hsin and established as a
rule by Pai Chang Huai Hai. (In older Chinese Buddhist monas­
tic systems, only novices did manual labor.) One day when he
encountered a monk behind the monks' hall, he asked, "Where
have all the virtuous ones gone?" That monk said, "They have
all gone to work." The master then took a knife out of his
sleeve and handed it to the monk, saying, "My tasks as abbot
are many; I ask you, Elder, please cut off my head for me."
Then he extended his neck; the monk ran off.
Chao Chou's manner of teaching was called "Lip Ch'an,"
and it was said that light issued from his lips when he spoke.
Many sayings of his are recorded, and his repeated appearance
in The Blue Cliff Record is evidence of their currency. In the
closing decades of the ninth century Chao Chou, Hsueh Feng,
and Yun Chu (Tao Ying, Tung Shan's great disciple) were the
most eminent Ch'an masters in China, but Chao Chou used to
say, "Even if you come from Hsueh Feng or Yun Chu, you are
still board-carrying fellows." Chao Chou's teaching style was

566

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

lofty indeed, and he produced thirteen enlightened s uccessors,
but there were few who could match, let alone surpass him, so
his transmission line died out after a few generations.
A monk asked, "In the aeon of emptiness, is there still
someone cultivating practice?" The Master said, "What do you
call the aeon of emptiness?" The monk said, "This is where not
a single thing exists." The Master said, "Only this can be called
real cultivation."
A monk asked, "The Buddha Dharma is remote; how should
I concentrate?" The Master said, "Observe how the Former
Han and Latter Han dynasties held the whole empire; yet when
the end came, they hadn't a farthing."

MA TSU TAO I
CASE

(709-788)

3

(Ma Tsu, "A>1cestor Ma," also called Great Master Ma, was one
of the most illustrious Ch'an masters of all time, the teacher of
one hundred and thirty-nine enlightened successors. His
teacher was Huai Jang of Nan Yueh, one of the foremost heirs
of the Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng. The following is the account
of Ma Tsu's meeting with Huai Jang told in the Ching Te

Ch'uan Teng Lu:)

During the K'ai Yuan era (713-741)* an ascetic named Tao I
was dwelling in the Ch'uan Fa Temple; all day he sat meditat­
ing. Huai Jang knew that he was a vessel of Dharma, and went
to question him; "Great Worthy, what are you aiming at by
sitting meditation?" Ma replied, "I aim to become a Buddha."
)ang then took a tile and began to rub it on a rock in front of the
hermitage; Ma asked him what he was doing rubbing the tile.
Jang said, "I am polishing it to make a mirror." Ma said, "How
can you make a mirror by polishing a tile?" Jang said, "Granted
that rubbing a tile will not make a mirror, how can sitting
meditation make a Buddha?" Ma asked, "Then what would be
right?" Jang said, "It is like the case of an ox pulling a cart: if
the cart does not go, would it be right to hit the cart, or would it
be right to hit the ox?" Ma didn't reply.
Jang went on to say, "Do you think you are practicing sitting
meditation, or do you think you are practicing sitting Buddha­
hood? If you are practicing sitting meditation, meditation is

Biographies

567

not sitting or lying. If you are practicing sitting Buddhahood,
'Buddha' is not a fixed form. In the midst of transitory things,
one should neither grasp nor reject. If you keep the Buddha
seated, this is murdering the Buddha; if you cling to the form of
sitting, this is not attaining its inner principle."
Ma heard this teaching as if he was drinking ambrosia. He
bowed and asked, "How shall I concentrate so as to merge with
formless absorption?" Jang said, "Your study of the teaching of
the mind ground is like planting seeds; my expounding the
essence of reality may be likened to the moisture from the sky.
Circumstances are meet for you, so you shall see the Way."
Ma also asked, "If theWay is not color or form, how can I see
it?" Jang said, "The reality eye of the mind ground can see the
Way. Formless absorption is also like this." Ma asked, "Is there
becoming and decay, or not?" Jang said, "If one sees the Way as
becoming and decaying, compounding and scattering, that is
not really seeing the Way. Listen to my verse:
Mind ground contains various seeds;
When there is moisture, all of them sprout.
The flower of absorption has no form;
What decays and what becomes?

Ma heard this and his understanding was opened up. His heart
and mind were transcendent. He served his master for ten
years, day by day going deeper into the inner sanctum.
*This meeting probably took place in the mid 730's. Huai Jang had six
adept pupils, but he said it was Ma Tsu who realized his "heart."

HSUAN CH'IEN of Te Shan
CASE

(781-867)

4

(Among Te Shan's nine successors were Yen T'ou Ch'uan Huo
and Hsueh Feng I Tsun; he was the ancestor of both the Yun
Men and Fa Yen sects of Ch'an. Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu 15
gives the following account of him:)
Ch'an master Hsuan Ch'ien of Te Shan in Liang Chou was a
man of Chien Nan; his surname was Chou. In his youth he left
home, and when he came of age he was fully ordained as a
monk. He made a thorough study of the collection of regula-

568

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

tions, and penetrated the essential import of the various scrip­
tures expounding nature and its phenomenal expressions. He
frequently lectured on the Diamond Wisdom Scripture; his
contemporaries called him Diamond Chou.
Later he inquired into the Ch'an sect, whereat he said to his
fellow students, " A single hair embraces the sea, yet the sea's
nature is not diminished; a minute mustard seed falls upon a
sword blade-the sharpness of the sword does not move.
Whether there is something to learn or nothing more to learn,
onlyI know that."Then he went to Ch'an master Hsin of Lung
T'an. .. .
(After the events narrated in case
for some thirty years in Hunan.In

4, he dwelt in obscurity
845, when the emperor Wu

Tsung of T'ang tried to do away with Buddhism, Te Shan es­
caped to a stone grotto on a mountain.)
In the beginning of theTa Chung era (847-860), Hsueh Yen
Wang, the governor of Wu Ling (in Hunan), restored the monas­
tery onTe Shan and called it the Meditation Abode of Ancient
Worthies. He was going to look for a man of knowledge to
dwell there, when he heard of the master's practice of the Way.
Though he repeatedly invited him, the master did not come
down from the mountain. Yen Wang then fabricated a ruse,
sending a runner to falsely accuse the master of having violated
the laws regarding tea and salt. Having taken the master into
his domain, he looked up to him with reverence and insisted
that he dwell there, and reveal the way of the sect.
In the hall, the master said, "There is nothing in the self, so
do not seek falsely; what is attained by false seeking is not real
attainment. You just have nothing in your mind, and no mind
in things; then you will be empty and spiritual, tranquil and
sublime. Any talk of beginning or end would all be self­
deception. The slightest entanglement of thought is the foun­
dation of the three mires (hell, animality, hungry ghosthood); a
momentarily aroused feeling is a hindrance for ten thousand
aeons.The name'sage' and the label'ordinary man' are merely
empty sounds; exceptional form and mean appearance are both
illusions.If you want to seek them, how can you avoid trouble?
Even if you despise them, they still become a great source of
anxiety. In the end there is no benefit."
Hsueh Feng asked, "In the immemorial custom of the sect,
what doctrine is used to teach people?" The master said, "Our

Biographies

569

sect has no words; in reality there is no doctrine to be given to
mankind."
YenT'ou heard of this and said, "The old man of MountTe
has a spine as strong as iron; it cannot be broken. Even so,
when it comes to the way of expounding the teaching, he still
lacks something."
Before his death he said to his disciples, "Grasping empti­
ness and pursuing echoes wearies your mind and spirit. When
awakened from a dream, you realize it was false; after all, what
matter is there?" When he finished speaking, he died sitting at
rest.

(Kuei Shan was the foremost successor of Pai Chang Huai Hai;
the whisk which he showed toTe Shan in case 4 was given to
him by Pai Chang as a symbol of the transmission. Perhaps the
most famous teacher of his time in southern China, Kuei
Shan's community numbered fifteen hundred persons, and he
produced forty-three enlightened disciples. Among them, the
best known were Hsiang Yen Chih Hsien and Yang Shan Hui
Chi. Very little is known of Hsiang Yen's successors, but Yang
Shan's teaching line remained active for three or four more
generations; hence it came to be called theKuei-Yang Sect, the
earliest of the so-called 'Five Houses' of classical Ch'an. The
following sermon ofKuei Shan is taken from Ching Te Ch 'uan

Teng Lu 9:)
The mind of a man of the Way is straightforward, without
falsehood; there is no turning away nor turning towards, no
deceitful false mind. At all times his seeing and hearing are
normal; there are no further details or subtleties beyond this.
He does not close his eyes or block his ears; it is enough that
feelings do not attach to things.
Since time immemorial all the sages have only spoken of the
faults of impurity; if there is no such perverted consciousness,
opinion and thought habits, then it is like an autumn pond,
limpid and clean. Pure and clear, without contrivance, quies-

cent and still, without hindrance; such is called a man of the
Way. He is also called an unconcerned man.
(Kuei Shan also wrote a short book called the Ching Ts'e, or
'admonishing stick,' in which he points out the degeneracy of
Buddhists in his time, and speaks of the true aim of leaving
home. This book gained wide circulation in China, and was the
first sectarian Ch'an work to be published in Japan, in the year
1198; it is still current in Rinzai Zen circles.)

I TS'UN
CASES

of Hsueh Feng (822-908)
5, 22, 49, 51

Hsueh Feng first wanted to abandon home at the age of nine,
but he was prevented from doing so by his parents. At the age
of twelve, he went with his father to Yu Chien temple in Fu
T'ien (in Foochow): there he saw the preceptual master Ch'ing
Hsuan; he said, "This is my teacher," and remained at that
temple to serve Ch'ing Hsuan. At age seventeen, he had his
head shaved and changed his name to I Ts'un.
When Hsueh Feng was twenty-four, Buddhism was sup­
pressed by the command of the Emperor. In Confucian dress,
Hsueh Feng called on the Ch'an teacher Ling Hsun, spiritual
grandson of Ma Tsu. The following year, when the suppression
had been lifted, Hsueh Feng returned to Ling Hsun as a disci­
ple. Later, when he himself began to teach on Hsueh Feng (one
of the names of the mountain where he lived, after which he is
usually called, according to Ch'an custom), he modeled the
organization of his community after that of Ling Hsun.
At twenty-eight, Hsueh Feng was officially ordained at Pao
Ch'a temple in Yu Chou. Two years later his teacher Ling
Hsun died; after two more years had passed, at the age of thirty­
two Hsueh Feng resumed his travels. He was with Yen T'ou in
the community of Huan Chung (780-862, a successor of Pai
Chang) at Mt. Ta Tzu in Hang Chou, where they met Ch'in
Shan Wen Sui, an outstanding student of Huan Chung. The
three of them left Ta Tzu and travelled together to visit other
enlightened teachers.
Once in the course of their journey, Ch'in Shan stopped to
wash his feet in a stream, when he saw a vegetable leaf floating
by. He rejoiced and said, "There must be a man of the Way in

Biographies

571

these mountains; let us follow the stream and seek him out."
Hsueh Feng said, "Your eye of wisdom is cloudy; later on, how
will you judge others? His carelessness about material bless­
ings is such as this; what is he doing, dwelling in the moun­
tains?"
Eventually, as the commentary states, Hsueh Feng went to
T'ou Tzu three times and nine times to Tung Shan. The master
Ta T'ung of Mt. T'ou Tzu

(819-915) was a successor in the

fourth generation of the Shih T'ou line. Tung Shan Liang
Chieh, patriarch of the Ts'ao-Tung sect, a later branch of the
Shih T'ou (or Ch'ing Yuan) line, was one of the most famous
masters of the time; Ch'in Shan eventually remained and suc­
ceeded to the teaching of Tung Shan, whereas Hsueh Feng and
Yen T'ou succeeded to Te Shan.
Hsueh Feng was already forty years old when he met Te
Shan, who was then over eighty. Although he stayed there for
several years and is reckoned as a successor to Te Shan, in
reality it was by Yen T'ou's exhortation that he was thoroughly
liberated. Later he became a great teacher, a classic illustration
of the Ch'an proverb that "a superior vessel takes a long time
to complete."
After his enlightenment, at the age of forty-five Hsueh Feng
parted company with Yen T'ou and went back to Min
(Foochow): two years later he returned to Mt. Fu Jung ('Lotus
Mountain', where Ling Hsun had taught) and dwelt at ease
there in a stone grotto. Several followers who had sought him
out, especially one Hsing Shih Shih Po, who had been a fellow
student of his long before under Ling Hsun, urged him to "ap­
pear in the world" and teach. Finally, at the age of forty-nine,
he went to Hsiang Ku Shan, "Elephant Bone Mountain," where
two donors vied to provide for him. Because the mountaintop
was always covered with snow, it was called Hsueh Feng,
"Snowy Peak"; and at the age of fifty Hsueh Feng went to live
there and spent the next several years with his followers build­
ing a place to live and work.
Within ten years, the size of his community had reached
fifteen hundred people; so rapidly did his following incre:1se in
the early years that there was not enough room or ample provi­
sions for them all. Under Hsueh Feng's guidance, the commu­
nity was exemplary for its industry and austerity. The renown
of Hsueh Feng spread all over China, and in 882 he was given

572

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

an honorific purple vestment by the Emperor I Tsung, along
with the title Chen Chiao Ta Shih, "Truly Enlightened Great
Teacher." By the time of his death at the age of eighty-seven,
he had fifty-six enlightened disciples teaching in various
places; among them, several who figure in The Blue Cliff Rec­

ord were Hsuan Sha, E Hu, Ch'ang Ch'ing, Ching Ch'ing, Yun
Men, Sui Yen, and Pao Fu. Hsueh Feng's teaching line
flourished exceedingly through the Fa Yen and Yun Men sects,
and lasted about three hundred years in China.

WEN YEN of Yun Men
CASES

(?-949)

6, 8, 14, 15, 22, 27, 34

(Successor to Hsueh Feng, Yun Men taught in Kuangtung,
southern China; he produced over sixty enlightened disciples,
and was known as the founder of the Yun Men school of Ch'an,
which lasted into the thirteenth century, and whose masters
were responsible for the preservation of a great deal of Ch'an
literature. Noted for his wondrous and often abstruse sayings,
Yun Men forbade his disciples to record what he said; one of
his attendants stealthily wrote down his sayings on a paper
robe, preserving in this way an incredibly rich record of Yun
Men's words. The practice of reciting and investigating sayings
of earlier Ch'an masters seems to have been growing over a
long period of time, but Yun Men was one of the first classical
masters to make extensive use of the words of Ch'an ancients
in guiding his own disciples. He is said to have originated
the form of tai-yu, or "substitute sayings," in which he answers
a question posed by himself, in behalf of his audience, or else
supplies an answer to a question or saying of an earlier master,
substituting for a speechless monk in a story; he also origi­
natedpieh yu , or "alternative saying," a reply or remark given
as an alternate to another in a story, or an alternate reply to one
-

of his self-posed self-answered questions. Other members of
Hsueh Feng's congregation were known to have discussed an­
cient and contemporary Ch'an sayings and doings extensively;
the Lin Chi school of Ch'an became well known for its use of

k'an-hua ch'an,

or "meditation contemplating sayings," dur­

ing the Sung dynasty, but the overt recommendation of this
practice is in early evidence in Yun Men's sayings. Remember

Biographies

573

also that Hsueh Tau, who collected the sayings and wrote the
poems which are the kernel of The Blue Cliff Record was a
master of the Yun Men school.The following excerpt from one
of Yun Men's speeches recorded in Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu
19 illustrates his approach to this technique:)
0 brethren! You have all called on teachers in various

places to settle life and death. Where you went, did not the
venerable adepts abiding there utter some compassionate
words of help to you? Are there still any phrases you did not
penetrate? Come forth and cite them and let's see. This old
fellow will haggle with you all....
Ordinary thieving cowards slurp up the spittle of others,
memorizing a bunch of miscellaneous trash: wherever they go
they run off at the mouth; with asses' lips and horses' chops
they boast, 'I know how to pose ten or five pivotal questions.'
Even if you go on like this morning to night until the end of
time, will you after all have ever seen anything, even in
dreams? What use has this in imparting strength to others?
Whenever anyone stakes the patchrobed monks to a meaL
people like this also say,'I have food to eat.' How are they even
worth talking to?On another day,before the King of Death,he
will not accept your verbal explanations.
0 brethren,if you have attained, you may spend your days
following the crowd in another house; but if you have not
attained,just do not pass the time taking it easy.You must be
most thoroughgoing.
The Ancients had a lot of problems to help you. These are
such as Hsueh Feng's saying, "The whole earth is you." Chia
Shan said, "Pick me out in the hundred grasses; recognize the
emperor in a bustling market place." Lo P'u said, "As soon as a
mote of dust arises, the entire earth is contained therein; on
the tip of a hair, the whole body of the Lion is all there." You
take hold, and contemplate them over and over again; over
long days and many years, you will naturally find a way of
entry. In this task,no one can substitute for you; it rests with
each individual, without exception.
(The following examples are taken from the Yun Men Kuang
Lu, to illustrate something of Yun Men's commentary style:)

Quoting Chia Shan's saying, "Find me in the hundred gras­
ses," the master joined his palms and said,"How are you?How
are you?" Then he pointed at a pillar with his staff and said,
"Chia Shan has turned into a pillar-look! Look!"

(The 'three phrases' of Yun Men is a descriptive term first
used by Yun Men's successor Te Shan Yuan Mi; the following
verses by Yuan Wu describing the three phrases are taken from
the fen T'ien Yen Mu:)

Fundamental reality, fundamental emptiness;
One form, one flavor-it is not that a subtle
entity does not exist.
It is not a matter for hesitating over; clear and lucid,
This contains the whole world.
It is fundamentally not a matter of interpretation
or understanding;
When you sum it all up, it's not worth a single letter.
When myriad activities abruptly cease,
That is cutting off the myriad streams.
When you allow the presence of another,
Follow the sprouts to descry the ground,
Understand the person by means of his words;
This is going along with the ripples, following the
waves.

Revered as the founder of the Fa Yen sect of Ch'an, he was a
successor of Lo Han Kuei Ch'en.

*

Kuei Ch'en's teacher had

heen Hsuan Sha, and the compiler of the Ching Te Ch'uan

Teng Lu refers to Fa Yen as a reviver of the Hsuan Sha sect.
Fa Yen had his head shaved at the age of seven, and sub­
sequently studied both Buddhist and Confucian teachings.
Later he gave up these pursuits and headed for southern China
to seek sudden enlightenment. First he went to the congrega­
tion at Ch'ang Ch'ing in Fu Chou, under the master Hui Leng.

It is said that he was highly esteemed there in spite of the fact
that his clinging mind was not yet at rest.
Resuming his travels with several companions, at one point
Fa Yen was stopped in his tracks by weather conditions and put
up at the Ti Ts'ang temple, where the master Kuei Ch'en was
abiding at the time. Kuei Ch'en asked him, "Where are you
going?" He replied, "I am going to continue wandering around
on foot." Ch'en asked, "What is the purpose of your travel?"
He replied, "I do not know." Kuei Ch'en said, "Not knowing is
closest to it."
According to the Ch 'uan Teng Lu, Fa Yen was enlightened at
these words, and remained at Ti Ts'ang along with three com­
panions, seeking absolute certainty. The record in the Wu Teng
Hui Yuan states that they went on to discuss the Chao Lun, a

fourth century Chinese Buddhist treatise; when they got to the
point where it says, "Heaven and earth and I have the same
root," Ch'en asked Fa Yen, "Are the mountains, rivers, and
earth identical to your own self, or separate?" Fa Yen said,
"Separate." Kuei Ch'en held up two fingers; the master said,
"Identical." Ch'en again held up two fingers, then got up and
left.
When Fa Yen was about to depart, Kuei Ch'en saw him to
the gate, whereupon he asked, "You always say that the three
worlds are only mind, and myriad things are only conscious­
ness;" then he pointed to a rock in the garden and said, "But
tell me, is this rock inside your mind or outside your mind?" Fa
Yen said, "It is inside my mind." Kuei Ch'en said, "What rea­
son does a traveller have to put a rock in his head?" Fa Yen was
stumped and had no reply. So he put down his bundle and
stayed by Kuei Ch'en to seek certainty.
For over a month he daily expressed his understanding and
spoke of the principle. Ch'en said to him,

"The Buddha

Dharma is not like this." Fa Yen said, "My words are
exhausted, my reason come to an end." Kuei Ch'en said, "If
one were to discuss the Buddha Dharma, all things would ap­
pear in full." At these words, Fa Yen was greatly enlightened.
(Wu Teng 10)

Later, he dwelt in the Ch'iung Shou Temple in Lin Ch'uan,
where he began to teach. When Tzu Fang, an elder monk from
the Ch'ang Ch'ing community came to call on him, Fa Yen

576

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

quoted Hui Leng's verse and said, "What is the unique body
revealed in the midst of myriad forms?" Tzu Fang raised his
whisk; Fa Yen said, "How can you understand it thus?" Tzu
Fang said, "What is the master's honorable opinion?" Fa Yen
said, "What do you call myriad forms?" Tzu Fang said, "The
Ancients did not eliminate myriad forms." Fa Yen said, "In
myriad forms there is a single body revealed; why talk about
eliminating or not eliminating?" At these words, Tzu Fang was
greatly awakened; he expressed himself in verse and submitted
in sincerity.
Henceforth, people in congregations everywhere who were
conscious of their understanding came in droves; at first they
were unyielding, but the Master subtly aroused and awakened
them, so that all of them eventually submitted to him. His
ocean of followers was never less than one thousand persons.

(Ch'uan Teng Lu 24)
(Fa Yen, the name by which Wen I is usually known to
posterity, is an abbreviation of his posthumous title Ta Fa Yen
Ch'an Shih, 'Meditation Master with the Great Eye of Reality.'
He was also entitled Ch'ing Hui, 'Pure Wisdom,' and Ta Chih
Tsang Ta Tao Shih, 'Great Guide, Repository of Great Knowl­
edge.' His writings were said to have amounted to several tens
of thousands of words; much, however, has been lost to post­
erity. Still extant, however, are a number of poems, and a
treatise entitled Tsung Men Shih Kuei Lun, 'Ten Guidelines for
the School,' an elegant treatise on Ch'an and a denunciation of
the decadence of Ch'an schools in his time. Fa Yen had sixty­
three enlightened disciples, including Te

Shao, National

Teacher of Wu-Yueh, Wen Sui, National Guide of Chiang Nan,
and Hui Ch'u, National Teacher of Koryo, a Korean kingdom.
The Fa Yen school flourished greatly into the third generation,
but died out by the fifth, after about one hundred years. Te
Shao also did much to revive the T'ien T'ai teachings in China;
his disciple Yen Shou was also considered a patriarch of the
Pure Land school, and was a great scholar and prodigious au­
thor.)
*In some books he is referred to as Ti Ts'ang, in others, Lo Han; he
lived for a while inTiTs'ang temple, where Fa Yen met him. Later he
moved to Lo Han temple in Chang Chou.

Almost nothing is known of this master, beyond that he was a
successor of Hsueh Feng. The compilers of the Tsu T'ang Chi
state, "We have never seen any record of his doings. King
Ch'ien respected him, and bestowed on him a purple vestment
and the title Yung Ming Ta Shih, 'Great Teacher of Eternal
Brilliance.' "
King Ch'ien* was Ch'ien Liu, entitled King of Yueh in 902,
and later became the King of Wu and Yueh in 907, under the
new Liang dynasty.
There was a saying that one's eyebrows will fall out if one
talks too much; in the version of this example recorded in the

Tsu T' ang Chi, Ts'ui Yen says 'for the last thirty years' rather
than 'this summer.' Judging from the paucity of his record, he
died with his eyebrows on. There are, however, one or two
sayings left:
A monk once asked, "When the ancients lifted the gavel or
stood up the whisk, what was the inner meaning?"
Ts'ui Yen said, "A false teaching is hard to maintain."
The other characters in example 8 were also disciples of
Hsueh Feng, and this is, no doubt, where this incident took
place. Later on, Ts'ui Yen had two enlightened successors, of
whom equally little is known as of their master.

A monk asked, "If one wants to arrive on the Birthless Road,

According to the Ch'uan Teng Lu (18),
"He was a man of Yen Kuan in Hang Chou; his lay surname
was Tsun. As a child, he was of pure and peaceful nature. When
he was thirteen years old he left home and received the pre­
cepts at T'ung Hsuan temple in Su Chou; then he traveled
around visiting the Ch'an 'shops'.
"In 878 he went into Min and called on Hsi Yuan; then he
visited Ling Yun, but he still had lingering doubts. Later he
went to Hsueh Feng, and his feelings of doubt melted like ice."
According to the Tsu T'ang Chi (10),
"When he first went to study under Hsueh Feng, his tasks in
the study were bitterly painful; he was not too brilliant. Hsueh
Feng saw him going on like this and stopped him, saying, 'I am
giving you a prescription for medicine for a dead horse; do you
find it sweet?'
"He said, 'I will abide by the Master's judgement.'
"Hsueh Feng said, 'You do not need to come up here three or
five times every day: just know how to be like a wooden pillar
in a blazing fire in the mountain; put your body and mind at
rest, for maybe as many as ten years, perhaps seven, or at least
three years, and you will surely have understanding.'
"He followed Hsueh Feng's direction for two and a half
years; one night his mind was active and he could nut sit still,

so he went outside the temple building, walked three times
around the tea garden, and sat down under a tree. Suddenly, as
he was falling asleep, he awoke and returned to the temple.
Going up from the eastern hall, the moment he entered the
monks' hall he saw the lamp loom large and immediately had
understanding. Thereupon he went to the Master Hsueh Feng's
place, but before the master got up, he went away instead;
leaning on the pillar of the teaching hall, he unconsciously let
out a cry.
"The Great Teacher heard it and asked, 'Who is it?'
"Hui Leng called out his name; the Great Teacher said,
'What are you doing, coming here in the middle of the night?'
"He said, 'I have had an extraordinary perception.'
"The Great Teacher himself got up and opened the gate; he
grabbed Hui Leng's hand and asked him about his inner condi­
tion. The latter, expressing his inner feeling, said in a verse,
Wonder of wonders!
Rolling up a bamboo blind, I see the whole world*
If anyone asks me what sect I understand,
I would lift up my whisk and hit them right in the
mouth!"

According to Wu Teng Hui Yuan (7L
"He asked Ling Yun* * 'What is the big idea of the Buddhist
teaching?'
"Ling Yung said, 'Before the business with the donkey is
over with, a problem comes up with the horse.'
"The master went back and forth between Hsueh Feng and
Hsuan Sha like this for a period of twenty years, and wore out
seven sitting mats, but still did not clearly understand this
matter. One day as he rolled up a bamboo blind, he was sud­
denly greatly awakened; thereupon he had a verse . . . (same as
above).
"Hsueh Feng quoted this to Hsuan Sha and said, 'This lad
has finished.' Hsuan Sha said, "Not yet; this is an expression of
conscious knowledge. He should be tested again.'
"In the evening, when the community of monks appeared to
ask questions, Hsueh Feng said to the master, 'Ascetic Pei
(Hsuan Sha) does not approve of you. If you really have correct
realization, bring it up before the community.' The master
again had a verse, saying,

The master asked Hsueh Feng, "All sages from antiquity
have transmitted and received a single path; please point it out
to me."
Hsueh Feng remained silent; the master bowed and with­

The master entered the abbot's quarters; Hsueh Feng said,
"What is it?"

The master usually carried out his activities in secret; he al­

Because of this they called him "Ch'en the straw sandal

He first dwelt in Lung Hsing Temple in Mu Chou: he hid his
traces and concealed his activity. He made straw sandals and
secretly placed them on the street; after many years people
came to know of this, so they called him "straw-sandal
Ch'en." At the time, when there were students who sought his

this, people from all quarters sought refuge with him and called
him Reverend Ch'en.

Ch'uan Hsin Fa Yao, 'Essential Method of

Transmission of Mind,' recorded by prime minister P'ei Hsiu;
this version is taken from

Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu 9:)

The Buddhas and all sentient beings are only one mind;
there is nothing else. This mind, since beginningless past, has
never been born, never perished; it is not green, not yellow; it
has no shape or form. It is not subject to existence or non­
existence, and is not to be considered new or old. It is not long
or short, nor is it large or small; it transcends all limitation,
measurement, names, words, traces or oppositions. This very
substance is it; stir your thoughts and you miss it. It is like
empty space; it has no bounds, and cannot be measured. Just
this one mind itself is Buddha. Buddha and sentient beings are
no different; it's just that sentient beings grasp appearances­
seeking outwardly, they become more and more lost. If you
employ Buddha to seek Buddha, use mind to grasp mind, you
may go on all your life until the end of time, but will never
succeed. Don't you realize that if you cease thinking and forget
thought, Buddha will spontaneously appear?

(The following is from

Tsu T'ang Chi 10:)

Master Ching Ch'ing succeeded to Hsueh Feng. He lived in
Yueh Chou (Fukien). The master's name was Tao Fu; he was
(originally) a man of Wen Chou (in Chekiang). When the mas­
ter first went into Min (Fukien) he called on Ling Yun (a suc­
cessor of Kuei Shan) and asked, "How do you point out the
truth of the great concern of foot travelling?" Yun said, "What
is the price of rice in Chekiang?" The master said, "I almost
understood it as the price of rice." Then he continued on to
Hsiang Ku (Hsueh Feng).
Hsueh Feng asked him, "Where are you from?" He replied,
"I'll never say I was born and raised in Wen Chou." Feng said.
"Then the Enlightened Overnight Guest (Yung Chia, a succes­
sor of the Sixth Patriarch) is a fellow villager of yours." He said,
"Where was the Enlightened Overnight Guest from?" Feng
said, "This lad deserves to be given a score of blows, but I'll let
it go."
The master also asked,

"Since antiquity, the ancestral

worthies have spoken of the simile of an entry road; is this
right or not?" Feng said, "Right." He said, "I am a beginner,
only lately come to study; I request you, teacher, to point out
an entry road." Feng said, "Just enter from here." The master
said, "I am enshrouded with ignorance; again I ask you to point
it out."

(n. b.

Hsueh Feng's answer is not too clear; one charac­

ter in the text is indistinct. Both the

and the Wu Teng Hui Yuan omit this stmy altogether. Hsueh
Feng's answer seems to be, "I don't have many today; why
spraw 1 out and fall right over?" Or it may read, "Hsueh Feng
said, 'Today I am not too steady,' and he sprawled himself out
and fell over.")
According to Wu Teng Hui Yuan 7, at the age of six he didn't
eat meat; when his parents force fed him with dried fish, he
would immediately vomit it out. Eventually he sought to leave
home, and received ordination at the state K'ai Yuan Temple in
his native Wen Chou. Then he went foot travelling.
(The following is from Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu 18; it ac­
cords with the Tsu Tang Chi except for slight vocabulary dif­
ferences:)
One day the Master asked, "Did the ancient worthies not
transmit mind by mind?" Hsueh Feng said, "And they did not
set up written words or spoken phrases." He said, "If you don't
set up written words or spoken phrases, how will you transmit
it, teacher?" Hsueh Feng remained silent. The master bowed in
thanks. Hsueh Feng said, "Shouldn't you ask something
further?" He said, "I ask you for a question, teacher." Hsueh
Feng said, "Is it just so, or do you think there is some other
consideration besides?" He said, "For you teacher, just so is all
right." Hsueh Feng said, "What about for you?" He said,
"Turning completely away from people." (The CTL stops here;
the TTC continues,) Hsueh Feng said, "What is the business of
not turning away?" The master immediately bade fare-thee­
well.
Hsueh Feng once said to the assembly, "Splendidly refined."
The master came forth and said, "What splendid refinement is
this?" Hsueh Feng got up and said, "What did you say?" The
master then retreated and stood there.
Hsueh Feng said, "This matter is so noble, so refined." The
master responded by saying, "In the years since (I) Tao Fu has
been here, I have never heard the teacher instruct like this."
Hsueh Feng said, "Although I hadn't before, now I already
have; there's nothing wrong, is there?" He said, "I do not dare
(to say so). This is only what the teacher cannot avoid." Hsueh
Feng said, "Let me be like this." The master gained true entry
by this, but for a while he still followed the congregation. In
Min he was called 'Cloth-robed Little Fu.'

As they were working, Hsueh Feng quoted Kuei Shan's say­
ing about seeing mind upon seeing form and asked the master,
"Is there any fault or not?" The master said, "What was the
ancient concerned about?" Hsueh Feng said, "Although you
are right, I still want to deliberate with you." The master said,
"Then it would be better if I went on hoeing."
One day Hsueh Feng asked the master, "Where have you
come from?" He said, "From outside." Hsueh Feng said,
"Where did you meet Bodhidharma?" He said, "Where else?"
Hsueh Feng said, "I still don't believe you yet." He said,
"Teacher, don't vilify me so." Hsueh Feng approved of him.
Later he travelled all over to various places, adding more to his
temporal wisdom.
(First he dwelt at Ching Ch'ing, then at T'ien Lung and Lung
Ts'e temples; King Ch'ien of Min greatly respected him, and
requested him to teach in these places. The Ch'uan Teng Lu
says that mystic studies flourished in Wu-Yueh during his
teaching there.)
Someone asked, "An Ancient (Tung Shan) had a saying, 'A
man who is mindless unites with the Way'; how does a man
without mind unite with the Way?" The master said, "Why do
you not ask about 'The Way is mindless of union with man''"
"How is it that The Way is mindless of union with man'?" The
master said, "Though the white clouds may come to the blue
mountain peak, how can the bright moon descend from the
blue sky?"
(According to the Tsu T'ang Chi,) a monk asked, "What is
'leaping high'?" The master said, "Your eyes look upon the
(most rare) Udambara (flower) as like a yellow leaf." "What is
the Udambara like?" The master said, "It appears once in an
aeon." "What is the yellow leaf?" The master said, "This is not
yet real." The monk said, "Then there must still be something
yet more transcendental." The master said,

"Obviously."

"What is the transcendental thing?" The master said, "When
you drink the water of the Mirror Lake in one gulp, then I'll tell

"What is the single straight path to the spiritual source?"

Patriarch.His lay surname was Jan; he was a man of Chu Chow
district in Yueh Chou (Fukien).When he was a child at home,
he never spoke, nor did he ever cross the bridge in front of his
house, up until the time he was sixteen years old, when a
certain Ch'an master came; as soon as the boy saw him from
afar, he ran out and over the bridge to greet him and pay obei­
sance....His father, mother, relatives and neighbors from far
and near all came and discussed this in amazement; they said,
"How imponderable it is that since his infancy till his six­
teenth year we have never once seen this boy speak, nor have
we ever seen him cross the bridge in front of the house.But the
moment he saw the monk, he acted like this. Perhaps this boy
is different from ordinary people."
The boy then asked the Ch'an master, "I beg the master's
compassion, to receive and ordain one of the living.I earnestly
wish to take refuge in meditation and leave home."
The Ch'an master said, "The fact is that in the school of our
sect, only the crown prince of a silver wheel-turning king, the
grandson of a gold wheel-turning king, is able to continue the
way of this school without letting it decline; you are a kid
reared on a buffalo's back by a man and woman in a village of
three families; how could you enter the gate of this sect? It is
not something for which you are suited."
The boy said, "I submit to the Ch'an master that this teach­
ing is of equanimity; there is no high or low. How can you
speak so as to hinder my good intention?I ask the master again
to extend your compassion and admit me."
The Ch'an master observed the boy's state, and said, "You
shouldn't leave home like this to follow me."
The boy said, "Then to whom should I resort to leave home?
Ch'an teacher, direct me to a master of the sect."
The Ch'an master said, "Have you ever heard of Ts'ao
Ch'i?"
The boy said, "I do not even know what region Ts'ao Ch'i is
in."
The Ch'an master said, "On Mt. Ts'ao Ch'i in Kuang Nan
(Canton) there is a Good Friend; he is called the Sixth Pat­
riarch, and his community is as large as six hundred. You go
there to leave home.I am travelling to Mt.T'ien T'ai; you just
go by yourself."
The boy then went into the bush and hid; avoiding his par-

588

ents, he immediately went. Three days' journey he traveled in
two days; when it rained, he made a day's journey in one day.
When he reached Ts'ao Ch'i, he luckily came at a time when
the Patriarch was just about to expound the teaching. Im­
mediately he bowed to the Patriarch. The Patriarch asked him,
"Where do you come from?"
He replied, "I have just come near."
The Patriarch said, "Where were you born?"
The boy said, "Since having gotten the five skandhas, I have
forgotten."
The Patriarch said, "Come near." The boy approached. The
Patriarch said, "Tell me truly where you are from."
The boy said, "I am from Che Chung."
The Patriarch said, "You have come a long way to get here;
what did you come for?"
The boy said, "For one thing, an enlightened teacher is dif­
ficult to encounter, and the true teaching is hard to hear. Sec­
ondly, I want to submit to you and abandon home. I beg the
master's compassion to admit me."
The Patriarch said, "I tell you, don't abandon home."
The boy said, "Why do you say this?"
The Patriarch said, "You are a Sovereign; without moving
shield or spear, for sixty years the Son of Heaven will be you.
Just become an Emperor, and Buddhism will be principal."
The boy said, "I submit to the master that I would not want
to be Son of Heaven for one hundred years, let alone sixty. I beg
the master's compassion to accept me and let me abandon
home."
The master then touched his head and gave him a predic­
tion; "If you abandon home, you will be a Buddha standing
alone in the world." Then he took him in and accepted him. He
was on Mt. Pai Ya of Nan Yang cultivating his practice for forty
years.
In 761 on the sixteenth day of the first month, he obeyed the
summons of Emperor Su Tsung calling him to the capital,
where he stayed in the western meditation hall of the Temple
of a Thousand Blessings. Later he returned to the Abode of
Light Temple. Both emperors Su Tsung and Tai Tsung person­
ally accepted the bodhisattva precepts from him, and respect­
fully entitled him National Teacher.

meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the West?" Tung Shan
said, "When the Tung River reverses its flow, then I'll tell
you." At this Lung Ya was enlightened. He stayed with Tung
Shan for seven or eight more years. Later he had a following of
five hundred disciples, and was entitled Great Master Witness

asked Tan Hsia, "What is the teacher of all Buddhas?" Tan
Hsia upbraided him, saying, "Fortunately you are fine on your
own; why do you want to hold onto a wiping cloth?" The
master retreated three steps: Tan Hsia said, "Wrong!" The
master then moved forward; Tan Hsia said, "Wrong! Wrong!"
The master lifted one leg, turned his body around, and left; Tan
Hsia said, "You've got it, all right, but you're turning away

this.

I HSUAN

of Lin Chi (?-867)

CASES 20, 32

(The story of Lin Chi's enlightenment given in the Tsu Tang
Chi 19 is quite different from that in the Lin Chi Lu, the 'Re­
cord of Lin Chi,' compiled by his distinguished disciple San
Sheng Hui Jan. The latter version is given, with some variation,
in the commentary to case 11; the Tsu T'ang Chi version is
as follows:)
Master Huang Po said to his community, "In the old days I
had a companion in the Way, a fellow student of Ta Chi (Ma
Tsu), named Ta Yu (according to the Ch'uan Teng Lu, Ta Yu
was actually a successor of Kuei Tsung Fa Ch'ang, who was a
successor to Ma Tsu). This man travelled on foot all over, and
his Dharma eye was clear all the way through. Now he is at Ta
An; he does not like to dwell among crowds, but lives alone in
a mountain hut. When we parted, he made a covenant with me,
saying, 'Later on, if you should meet a spiritually sharp person,
send one to call on me.'"
At that time the master (Lin Chi) was in the community;
after he heard this, he immediately went to call (on Ta Yul.
Once he got there, he told (Ta Yu) all of what (Huang Po) had
said. In the evening, in the presence of Ta Yu he spoke of the
treatise on Yoga and discussed 'only consciousness. ' He also
asked questions on difficult points, but Ta Yu remained aloof
all night and did not answer. When dawn came, (Ta Yu) said to
the master (Lin Chi), "This old monk lives alone in a mountain
hut; considering that you came a long way, I let you stay for a
night. Why have you been shamelessly spewing filth before me
all night?" When he had spoken, (Ta Yu) beat (Lin Chi) several
times with his staff, pushed him out the door and shut it.

Biographies

591

The master returned to Huang Po and told him what had
happened. When Huang Po heard this, he lowered his head and
said, "An adept is like a blazing fire. It is lucky that you met a
man; why then did you go in vain?"
The master again went to see Ta Yu. Ta Yu said, "Before you
had no shame; what is your reason for coming again today?"
When he finished speaking, he drove him out the door with his
staff.
The master again returned to Huang Po and said to him,
"This time I have not come back empty." Huang Po said,
"Why?" The master said, "At one blow of the staff I entered the
realm of Buddhas: even if I had my bones shattered and my
body smashed for a hundred aeons and circled Mount Sumeru
countless times carrying it on my forehead, I could never re­
quite this profound debt of gratitude."
Huang Po, hearing this, rejoiced exceedingly in it; he said,
"You know how to rest, and even assert yourself on your own."
After ten days, the master again took leave of Huang Po and
went to Ta Yu's place. As soon as Ta Yu saw him, he im­
mediately went to strike him: the master grabbed the staff and
immediately pushed Ta Yu down; then he struck him on the
back several times with his fist. Ta Yu then nodded repeatedly
and said, "Dwelling alone in a mountain hut, I thought I had
spent my whole life in vain; I never expected that today I
would after all find a son." ... Henceforth the master served
Ta Yu for over ten years.
(Lin Chi had twenty-one successors, but not very much is
known about them. Four of them, including the main figure of
case 85, were hermits. One of his successors, Chih Kuan of
Kuan Ch'i (cf. verse, case 52), also studied for three years under
the nun Mo Shan, who was a disciple of the aforementioned Ta
Yu. He served as the gardener in her community; later he said,
'I got half the ladle from poppa Lin Chi and half the ladle from
marna Mo Shan; together they made the whole ladle, and hav­
ing partaken, to this day I've been full, never hungry.' Hsing
Hua Tsun Ching, whose line continued longest, also worked
with San Sheng, Lin Chi's successor, and Wei Fu Ta Hsueh,
another successor of Huang Po, after Lin Chi's death, before he
was fully enlightened to Lin Chi's meaning, but he considered
Lin Chi his teacher. San Sheng compiled the Lin Chi Lu, but
the original version is lost, and this text, one of the most im­
portant documents of T'ang Ch'an, exists in a compilation

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

made by a later master of the Yun Men sect. The disturbed
conditions in Northern China, where the early Lin Chi sect
was mainly based, probably contribute to the gaps in our
knowledge of this school in the ninth and early tenth cen­
turies. The Lin Chi sect almost died out after the fourth gener­
ation, but was greatly revived by the disciples of Shou Shan
Hsing Nien (925-993), the successor of Feng Hsueh Yen Chao
(896-973i cases 38, 61). During the eleventh century, in the
eighth generation of the sect, two outstanding masters ap­
peared, Yang Ch'i Fang Hui and Huang Lung Hui Nan, from
whom flowed what came to be known as the Yang Ch'i and
Huang Lung branches. It was in the former lineage that Yuan
Wu K'o Ch'in, the commentator of The Blue Cliff Record, ap­
pearedi this branch endured longer than the Huang Lung
branch, and flourished exceedingly during the Southern Sung
dynasty, with Yuan Wu producing more than one hundred suc­
cessors, among whom Ta Hui also produced more than fifty.
Many streams of Lin Chi Ch'an were introduced to Japan dur­
ing the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuriesi by that

time contemplation of the kung an was firmly established in
the Lin Chi sect as a principal method, and this is true in the
derivative Japanese Rinzai schools today.)

FOURFOLD HOST AND GUEST

Followers of the Way, according to the understanding of the
Ch'an school, death and life are successive. Students, you must
be very thorough-going. When host and guest see each other,
then there is discussion back and forth. One may show his
form to adapt to the person, or one may make use of the entire
body: one may use situational strategy with joy or anger, or one
may show half of himselfi one may ride on a lion, or one may
ride on an elephant.
If there is a true student, he will immediately shout, first
setting forth a bowl of glue. If the teacher doesn't discern this

Biographies

593

as an object, then he goes to that object and acts in various
ways. The student then shouts, but the former will not agree to
let go. This is a mortal disease, and cannot be cured; it is called
a guest looking at a host.
Or it may be that the teacher doesn't bring anything out, but
just follows the student's questions to dispossess him. The
student, being dispossessed, won't let go till the death. This is
host looking at guest.
Or there may be a student who comes before the teacher in a
state of purity. The teacher, discerning that this is an object,
takes it and throws it into a pit. The student says, 'Good
teacher!' Then the teacher says, 'Bah! You do not know good
from bad.' The student then bows. This is called host looking
at host.
Or there may be a student who comes before the teacher
wearing stocks and bound with chains. The teacher adds an­
other layer of stocks and chains, and the student rejoices;
neither of them are discerning. This is called guest looking at
guest.
Worthies, what I have raised here is all to discern demons
and pick out heretics, to know their falsehood or verity.

FOURFOLD ILLUMINATION AND FUNCTION

Sometimes I first illumine and then function; sometimes I first
function and then illumine. Sometimes illumination and func­
tion are at the same time, and sometimes illumination and
function are not at the same time.
I first illumine and then function when there is still person
(subject). I first function and then illumine when there are still
phenomena (object). Illumination and function at the same
time is 'driving away the plowman's ox, taking away the hun­
gry man's food, smashing bone and taking the marrow, press­
ing needle and awl into the sore spot.'
When illumination and function are not at the same time,
there are questions, there are answers, guest and host are estab­
lished; it is mingling with the mud and water, responding to
potential in dealing with people.
If one is a man beyond measure, he will immediately get up
and go before it is mentioned, and still will get somewhere.

FOUR PROPOSITIONS

Sometimes I take away the subject (person), but not the object
(environment); sometimes I take away the object but not the
subject. Sometimes subject and object are both taken away,
and sometimes neither subject nor object is taken away.
A monk asked, "What is 'taking away subject but not ob­
ject'?"
The master said, "The warm sun bursts forth, spreading the
land with brocade; an infant's hair hangs down white as silk."
"What is 'taking away object but not subject'?"
The Master said, "The king's command is already in effect
all over the land; the general beyond the borders is free from
smoke and dust."
"What is 'subject and object both taken away' like?"
The master said, "The regions of Fen and P'ing have cut off

communication--they occupy one region alone." (N.b. Fen
and P'ing were two regions which had seceded from the control
of the T'ang dynasty.)
"What is 'neither subject nor object taken away' like?"
The master said, "The king ascends his jewel palace, old
peasants sing hallelujah."

THE FOUR SHOUTS

The Master asked a monk, "Sometimes a shout is like the
Diamond King's jewel sword, sometimes a shout is like a
golden haired lion crouching on the ground; sometimes a shout
is like a probing pole or reed shade; sometimes a shout does not
function as a shout: how do you understand?" The monk hesi­
tated, whereupon the Master shouted.

"I remember that in my mother's womb I had a saying:
today I quote it for everyonei you can't evaluate it rationally. Is
there anyone who can evaluate it? If you can't evaluate it,
thirty years hence do not quote it wrongly."
Hsueh Tou asked Chih Men, "When one doesn't arouse a
single thought, how can there be any fault?" Men called Hsueh
Tau to approachi as soon as Hsueh Tou came near, Chih Men
hit him right on the mouth with his whisk. As Hsueh Tou was
about to open his mouth, Chih Men hit him againi Hsueh Tou
was opened up and enlightened.
Li Tsun Hsu, a military governor under the Sung dynasty
and an enlightened lay student of Ch'an, petitioned the Em­
peror to honor Chih Men with a purple robe, symbolic of high­
est rank. The Emperor Jen Tsung (r. 1023-1063) granted the
purple vestment, but Chih Men refused to accept it. The Em­
peror, however, did not admit the master's refusal, and finally
Chih Men was obliged to accepti he said to his community,
"Although this old monk's original intention is to cover this
illusory body with shabby garments and fend off the pangs of
hunger with coarse food, I can do nothing about the fact that
the military governor has asked the Emperor to regale me with
a purple robei if I put it on, it will go against my original intent,
yet if I don't put it on, it will go against the will of the Emperor.
But leaving aside the issue of putting it on or not for the mo­
ment, you tell me: what robe did the patriarchs wear? If you
really know, though you wear clothes all day, you have never
put on so much as a single thread, and though you eat all day,
you have never chewed so much as a single grain of rice. If you
don't really know, watch this old monk put on this robe to­
day." (This incident is cited by Kato Totsudo in his Hekigan­

the Fa Yen Sect is referred to in the Ch'uan Teng Lu as the

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Hsuan Sha Sect. He was a successor of Hsueh Feng, and pro­
duced thirteen enlightened disciples.)
His Dharma name was Shih Pei; he was a man of Min dis­
trict in Foochow. His lay surname was Hsieh. When he was
young he liked to fish, and used to go out in a little boat on the
Nan T'ai river, associating with the fishing folk.
In the beginning of the Hsien T'ung era of the T'ang dynasty
when he was thirty years old, he suddenly wanted

(869-873),

to abandon the world. So he gave up his fish hook and boat, and
submitted to Ch'an master Ling Hsun of Lotus Mountain (a
successor of Kuei Tsung Fa Ch'ang, also Hsueh Feng's original
teacher), who shaved his head. He went to the K'ai Yuan Tem­
ple at Yu Chang and received full ordination from preceptual
master Tao Hsuan.
He wore a patched robe of coarse cloth and sandals made of
straw. He always sat peacefully all day long; the entire com­
munity considered him unusual.
He was a later come fellow student with Hsueh Feng I Tsun
in their original school (under the teacher Ling Hsun); and he
associated with (Hsueh Feng) like master and disciple. Because
of his painful practice, Hsueh Feng called him the ascetic.
One day Hsueh Feng asked, "Which one is Ascetic Pei?" He
replied, "I would never dare to deceive anyone."
Another day Hsueh Feng called him and said, "Ascetic Pei,
why do you not travel to study at other places?" He said,
"Bodhidharma did not come to China; the second patriarch did
not go to India." Hsueh Feng approved of this. (According to

Tsu T' ang Chi 10, Shih Pei started off on his journeys, but was
suddenly enlightened when he happened to stumble on a rock.
Afterwards he shouted and said, "Bodhidharma did not come
over; the second patriarch did not obtain the transmission.")
(When Hsueh Feng went to Elephant Bone Mountain in 872,
Hsuan Sha accompanied him and helped to build a monastery
there. He 'clearly discovered the mindground' when he read the
Surangama Sutra, and 'students of the mystery who had some
uncertainty would always seek further help from him.')

HERMIT HSIANG of Lotus Flower Peak
CASE

25

After enlightenment, before accepting a request to dwell in a
monastery as the guide of a community, Ch'an adepts usually

Biographies

spent years travelling and/or living in seclusion or semi­
seclusion, "maturing the holy embryo." Some, like Hsiang, the
hermit of Lotus Flower Peak (on Mount T'ien T'ai, one of the
five holy mountains of China), remained in humble cir­
cumstances as hermits all their lives, though small groups of
seekers would come to live near them and call on them for
instruction. The following brief sermon of hermit Hsiang,
taken from the Chih Yueh Lu, "Finger Pointing at the Moon,"
is the greater part of the very little information we have about
this Ch'an master:
"This matter is most urgent: you must clearly apprehend it;
once you get it clear, at all times you will avoid being bound up
and will be at ease wherever you are. Yet don't use your mind
to overcome by force; you must fit into the ancient groove
naturally. As soon as you get to study and analysis, you are
eager to make some principle into a standard for the Buddhist
teaching; (if you go on this way,) when will you ever attain to
rest of the mind ground? Elders, I ask you to be thoroughgoing
in this way."
The saying in case 25 was spoken by the hermit just before
he died.

circumstances of his enlightenment are told in case 53. Pai
Chang compiled the so-called 'pure standards' for Ch'an
monasteries, and is thus known as the founder of the indepen­
dent Ch'an monastic institution in China. From Pai Chang's
successors emerged the Kuei-Yang and Lin Chi sects of Ch'an.
The following sayings, excerpted from the extensive record of
his sermons, are in answer to a question about the essential
method for sudden enlightenment in the great vehicle:)
You should all first put an end to all ties, and lay to rest all
concerns; whether good or bad, mundane or transmundane,
anything at all-do not remember, do not recollect, do not
engage your thoughts with them. Abandon body and mind,
letting them be free. With mind like wood or stone, mouth
makes no object of distinction, mind pursues no activity; then

598

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

the mind ground becomes like space, wherein the sun of il­
lumination spontaneously appears. It is as though clouds had
opened and the sun emerged.
Just put an end to all fettering connections; feelings of greed,
anger, love, grasping, defilement and purity, all come to an end:
unmoved in the face of five lusts and eight winds, not entan­
gled by seeing, hearing, awareness, or knowledge, not confused
by various objective realms, naturally endowed with the won­
drous use of paranormal powers, this is a liberated man.
In the presence of all objects, mind being neither still nor
disturbed, neither concentrated nor scattered, passing through
all sound and form without lingering or obstruction, is called
being a man of the Way. Not setting in motion good, evil, right,
or wrong; not clinging to a single thing, not rejecting a single
thing, is called being a man of the great vehicle. Not bound by
any good, evil, emptiness, existence, defilement, purity, doing,
non-doing, mundane, supramundane, blessings, virtue, knowl­
edge or wisdom, is called Buddha wisdom.
Once affirmation and negation, like and dislike, approval
and disapproval, all various opinions and feelings come to an
end and can't bind, then one is free wherever he may be; this is
called a bodhisattva with a newly aroused mind immediately
ascending to the stage of Buddhahood.

The Master's lay surname was Wang, and he often referred to
himself as "Old Teacher Wang." In 757, at the age of ten, he
received instruction from the meditation master Ta Hui of Mt.
Ta Wei; at thirty, he went to Mt. Sung in Honan, one of the five
holy mountains of China, where he was formally ordained as a
Buddhist monk. He learned the doctrines of the Fa Hsiang
school, which analyzes existence into one hundred elements
and maintains that the world is created and maintained as it is
by the force of mental habit, giving a detailed account of the
workings of the mind. He also made a thorough study of the
Vinaya, monastic rules of conduct inherited from Indian
Buddhism. Then he travelled around, hearing the Lankavatara
"Entrance (of the Great Vehicle! into Ceylon" and Avatam-

saka (Hua

Yen ) "Flower Garland" scriptures expounded. The

former scripture maintains that all that can be known of the
world is purely subjective, and distinguishes three levels of
reality; pure mental construction; relative coexistence-of
sense, sense consciousness, and sense data-or interdependent
co-production; and perfectly real, which is emptiness: mental
construction is projected on relative coexistence, which, being
purely relative, has no ultimate basis in fact and is in reality
empty. The Flower Garland scripture also speaks of the relative
co-production of all things in the cosmos, which means that
everything is inherent in everything else; this is expressed
symbolically by the net of Indra, made of jewels which each
reflect all the other jewels, as well as the reflections of all the
jewels in each jewel, and so on, ad infinitum to the power of
infinity to an infinite infinity of powers: the ultimate pivot of
interdependence is that of mind and matter. Hence this scrip­
ture says that the cosmos is produced by the mind, yet the
mind does not exist of itself. Nan Ch'uan also studied the San
Lun or "ThreeTreatise" school, which teaches the Middle Way
based on the works of Nagarjuna and Kanadeva; accordingly,
he practiced the contemplations of emptiness, conditional
existence, and the mean.
Finally, after many years of study and practice, he called on
the great Ch'an Master Ma Tsu Tao I in Hung Chou (in
Kiangsi), and attained complete freedom. At the time there
were eight hundred people in Ma Tsu's congregation, and P'u
Yuan was considered the foremost; no one would dare to de­
bate with him. In 795 he went to Mt. Nan Ch'uan in Ch'ih
Chou (in Anwei), built himself a hut, and scratched out his
own subsistence from the mountainside. It is said that he
didn't come down from the mountain for over thirty years. In
the beginning of theTa Ho era

(827-836), he was invited by Lu

Hsuan to come down and teach. After that, his followers were
never less than several hundred. He had seventeen enlightened
disciples, including the famous Chao Chou, Ch'ang Sha, and
Tzu Hu. Among Ma Tsu's one hundred and thirty-nine en­
lightened disciples, Nan Ch'uan is considered along with Pai
Chang Huai Hai and Hsi T'ang Chih Ts'ang as the greatest of
all time. He once said, "People these days walk around with
'Buddha' on their shoulders; when you hear me say that mind
is not Buddha and wisdom is not the Path, you gather together

A monk asked, "What is a phrase responding to potential?"
The master was silent. "What is the hidden essence?" The
master said, "Close the door for me." "When Lu Tsu sat facing

"What is the truly correct eye of all time?" The master struck
his breast and said, "Alas! Alas!" "What is the master's family

Hui Chung, Ma Tsu, and Pai Chang; he was fully enlightened
with Kuei Shan, and stayed there for fifteen years. There are
various stories of his awakening. According to the fen T'ien

after he had received the teaching of ninety-seven

circular figures from Tan Yuan, who got it from Hui Chung,
when he came to Kuei Shan, the latter showed him the figure
of the empty circle-the 'full moon,' whereat he was en­
lightened. According to Dagen, the thirteenth century Japanese
master, Kuei Shan first set Yang Shan to work herding buffalo

for three years. T he following is from the Ch'uan Teng Lu 10:)
Yang Shan asked Kuei Shan, "What is the abode of the real
Buddha?"
Kuei Shan said, "With the subtlety of thinking the thought­
less, return thought to the boundlessness of the spiritual ef­
fulgence; when thought is exhausted, return to the source,
where nature and appearances always abide, phenomena and
principle are not two; the true Buddha is thus."
At these words Yang Shan was suddenly enlightened.
(Besides the use of circular figures, the dialogues of Kuei
Shan and Yang Shan are known as hallmarks of the Kuei-Yang
sect; Yang Shan once said that the essence of the sect was 'two
mouths without a single tongue/ symbolizing the meeting of
minds. The ninety-seven circular symbols handed down from
Hui Chung are now lost; it is said that Yang Shan burned the
book which contained them after he had read it once. Tan
Y uan, who had given it to him, lamented this, so Yang Shan
made another copy from memory and returned it to him. In
the twelfth century, a master of the Y un Men sect named P'u
Liang made a compilation containing forty or fifty examples,
but this work too is lost; it is known, however, that he arranged
them into six rubrics: 'circle,' 'merging of personality/ 'ocean
of meaning,' 'ocean of characters,' 'speech/ and 'silent dis­
course.')

He first dwelt at the Deer Park, where he was the first gener­

with circumstances and expounded the Dharma as was appro­
priate to the occasion. At the time he was called 'T he Teacher

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

In the hall he said, If I were to thoroughly uphold
the teaching of our sect, there would be weeds a
fathom deep in the teaching hall; (but) I am un­
able to avoid facing all of you people and saying
that the entire cosmos is the eye of a monk; the
entire cosmos is the whole body of a monk; the
entire cosmos is one's own light; the entire cos­
mos lies within one's own light; in the whole
cosmos there is no one who is not oneself.
I always tell you people that the Buddhas of the
triple world, the cosmos, and the mass of living
beings, are the light of great perfect wisdom.
When the light has not yet shone forth, where
can you people turn to become intimately ac­
quainted with it? Before the light shines forth,
there isn't even any news of Buddhas or sentient
beings; where do we get the mountains, rivers,
and eartht
At that time a monk asked, "What is the monk's eye?"
The master said, "Never, ever can one depart from it; (those
who) attain Buddhahood and become patriarchs cannot depart
from it; the six paths of transmigration cannot depart from it."
The monk said, "What is it that they cannot depart from?"
The master said, "In daytime, seeing the sun; at night, see­
ing stars."
The monk said, "I don' t understand."
The master said, "Marvelous towering mountains, their
color blue upon blue."
A monk asked, "Who is the teacher of all Buddhas?"
The master said, "By whom has he been concealed ever
since beginningless aeons?"
A monk asked, "How is it when the student does not depend
on the ground?"
The master said, "Where will you rest your body and live?"
He asked, "Then how is it when he does depend on the
ground?"
The master said, "Drag this corpse away!"
He asked, "What are 'different kinds'?"
The master said, "A foot is short, an inch is long."
The master sent a monk to ask Teacher Hui, a former fellow
student, "How is it after the teacher had seen Nan Ch'uan?"

Biographies

605

Hui was silent. The monk said, "How about before the teacher
had seen Nan Ch'uan?" Hui said, "There could not be another
besides." The monk returned and quoted this to the master.
The master spoke a verse, saying,
The unmoving man atop the hundred-foot pole:
Though he has gained entry, he is not yet real.
Atop the hundred-foot pole, he should step
forwardThe whole universe in the ten directions is his
whole body.

The monk then asked, "Atop the hundred-foot pole, how to ad­
vance?" The master said, "Mountains of Liang, rivers of Li."
The monk said, "I don't understand." The master said, "The
whole country is under the imperial sway."
(Many more sayings are attributed to Ch'ang Sha; he had
two enlightened successors.)

PAO CHI of P'an Shan in Yu Chou (n.d.)

(P'an Shan was a successor of Ma Tsu; his abode was in north­
ern China, near modern-day North Korea. He was one of the
few early Ch'an masters to teach in this region. Of his two
successors, P'u Hua is the only one about whom anything is
known; P'u Hua later assisted the great Lin Chi in his teaching.
The story of P'an Shan's enlightenment is given in Wu Teng
Hui Yuan 3.)

As the master was walking through a market place, he saw a
customer who was buying some pork say to the butcher, "Cut
me a pound of the fine stuff." The butcher put down his cleaver,
folded his hands and said, "Inspector, which isn't fine?" At this,
the master had insight.
Again one day when he had gone out of the monastery, he
saw people in mourning, singing and ringing bells: "The red
disc inevitably sinks into the west; we don't know where the
ghost will go." Inside an enclosure, a filial son was crying,
"Alas! Alas!" The master's body and mind leaped; he returned
and told Ma Tsu about it. Ma Tsu gave him his seal of approval.

606

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

(The saying which forms case 37 is taken from a longer ser­
mon of P'an Shan, other parts of which are repeatedly quoted in
Yuan W u's commentaries throughout the text. The following
version is from Ching Te Ch 'uan Teng Lu 7; given in paren­
theses are significant variants from the version given in Tsu
T'ang Chi 15:)
If there is no concern in the mind, myriad forms are unborn.
When the mind is devoid of subtle activity, where can a trace of
dust remain? The Way fundamentally has no substance; be­
cause of speaking, a name is established. The Way fundamen­
tally has no name; because of naming, an epithet is found. If
you say the very mind itself is identical to Buddha, still people
these days have not yet entered the profound subtlety; if you
say it is not mind, not Buddha, this is still the ultimate ex­
ample of pointing to the traces. The one road going upwards,
the thousand sages did not transmit; students toil over forms
like monkeys grasping at reflections. The Great Way has no
middle; who then goes forward or back? The eternal void is
without bound; how could it be measured? Since the void is
like this, how could the Way be spoken of? The mind-moon
solitary and full, its light engulfs myriad forms: the light is not
shining on objects, and the objects also do not remain; when
light and objects are both gone, then what thing is this? Ch'an
worthies, it is like hurling a sword into the sky; do not speak of
reaching or not reaching: then the wheel of the void is without
a trace, the sword's blade is without a flaw. If you can be like
this, mind and mental conditions are without knowledge. The
whole mind is identical to Buddha; the whole Buddha is identi­
cal to man. W hen mind and Buddha are not different, then this
is the Way. Ch'an worthies should study the middle path: like
the earth supporting a mountain, unaware of the mountain's
steep height; like a stone containing a gem, without knowing
the gem is flawless. If you can be like this, this is called Leav­
ing Home. Thus the Guide said, "Things fundamentally do not
hinder each other; the three times are also the same." A non­
doing, unconcerned man still has the problem of the golden
chains; therefore an Ancient said, "The spiritual source shines
alone; the Path is fundamentally birthless." Great wisdom is
not clarity; the true void is trackless. In true thusness, "ordi­
nary" and "holy" are all dream talk; "Buddha" and "Nirvana"
are both excess words. Ch'an worthies, you must see for your-

Biographies

607

selves; no one can substitute for you. There is nothing in the
triple world; where can mind be found? The four elements are
originally void; how can a Buddha abide? The turning potential
doesn't move (The oracle doesn't move); it is silent and rootless
(it is silent and speechless). Once it is presented right to your
face, there is nothing else. Farewell.

CHAO of Feng Hsueh (896-973)

CASES

Feng Hsueh originally studied Confucianism; he sat for the
civil service examination once, but failed. After that, he aban­
doned home to become a Buddhist. First he studied the 'stop­
ping and observing' methods of T'ien T'ai Buddhist medita­
tion; he then turned to Ch'an. He finally succeeded to Nan
Yuan Hui Yung, a third generation Lin Chi master. He first
taught at Feng Hsueh in Ju Chou (in Honan), at the request of
the community there. He spent a summer in the Yamen at
Ying Chou because the local army had revolted and the area
was in danger. Later he was requested to return to Ju Chou,
where he spent the last twenty-two years of his life teaching a
congregation of over a hundred students.
Hsing Nien of Shou Shan, who was a latecomer to Feng
Hsueh's community, served as the receiver of guests there: ac­
cording to the Wu Teng Hui Yuan 11, one day as he was stand­
ing by, Hsueh wept and said to him, "Unfortunately, the way of
Lin Chi, having reached me, is about to fall to the ground."
Hsing Nien said, "As you look upon this whole community, is
there no one at all?" Hsueh said, "There are many who are
intelligent, but few who perceive nature." Nien said, "W hat
about me?" Hsueh said, "Though I've had hopes for you for a
long time, I still fear you are addicted to this sutra and can't let
it go." (Hsing Nien constantly recited the Lotus Sutra to him­
self.) Nien said, "This too should be served: but I beg to hear its
essence." Hsueh then went into the hall and cited the World
Honored One's looking over the great crowd with his blue lotus
eyes, then said, "Tell me, at that time, what did he say? If
you say he spoke without speaking, this is still burying that
former sage. Tell me, what did he say?" Nien then shook out
his sleeves and left.

Hsueh threw down his staff and returned to the abbot's
room; his attendant followed him and asked for further instruc­
tion, saying, "Why did Nien not answer you, master?" Hsueh
said, "Nien understands."
The next day as Hsing Nien went along with gardener Chen
to inquire (into the master's health ), Hsueh asked Chen, "What
is the World Honored One's unspoken speech?" Chen said, "A
dove calling in a tree." Hsueh said, "Why do you make so much
abundance of folly? Why don't you thoroughly investigate the
spoken phrases?" He also asked Hsing Nien about it; Nien
said, "Activity upholds the ancient road, without falling into
passivity." Feng said to Chen, "Why don't you observe Nien's
comment?"
After Hsing Nien had received Feng Hsueh's seal of approval,
he obliterated his tracks and concealed his light.

(Shou Shan Hsing Nien (925-992) later appeared to teach, as
the first patriarch of Shou Shan; this was in the beginning of
the Sung dynasty, when the country was more stable. Shou
Shan had sixteen successors, among whom was Fen Yang Shan
Chao (947-1024), said to be an originator of poetic commen­
tary to ancient kung an. Fen Yang is said to have seen seventy­
one teachers, and attempted to synthesize the various illustra­
tive schemes of the Ch'an schools; the Lin Chi branch of Ch'an
flourished greatly with his successors and descendants, becom­
ing the dominant school of Buddhism in China.)

TA T 'UNG of Mt. T'ou Tzu (845-914)

41, 79, 80, 91

(The following is taken from the Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu

15)

He was a man from Huai Ning in Shu Chou (in Anhui); his
surname was Liu. He left home at an early age.... He first
practiced breath-contemplation; next he investigated the Hua
Yen teachings and discovered the ocean of nature. He visited
the Dharma assembly on Mt. Ts'ui Wei and was suddenly
awakened to Ts'ui Wei's source meaning. (This is told in the

Ch'uan Teng Lu 14:)
T'ou Tzu asked Ts'ui Wei, "I wonder, when the Second Pa­
triarch first saw Bodhidharma, what was really attained?" Ts'ui
Wei said, "What is attained right now when you see me?" One

Biographies

609

day as Ts'ui Wei was walking inside the Dharma Hall, T'ou
Tzu approached him, bowed, and asked, "Teacher, how do you
show people the secret message of the coming from the West?"
Ts'ui Wei stopped for a moment.T'ou Tzu again said, "Please,
Teacher, instruct me." Ts'ui Wei said, "Do you want a second
ladleful of foul water besides?" T'ou Tzu bowed in thanks and
withdrew.
(After this) T'ou Tzu wandered all over as he pleased, return­
ing to frequent his native territory. He concealed himself on
Mt. T'ou Tzu (which is in Shu Chou), built a grass hut, and
lived there.
(The following story leads up to the dialogue between Chao
Chou and T'ou Tzu that makes the Main Case

41:) One day

Master Shen of Chao Chou came to (a nearby district); T'ou
Tzu too had come down from the mountain that day.They en­
countered each other on the road without recognizing each
other. Chao Chou privately asked a lay gentleman and found
out it was T'ou Tzu.Then he turned back (to go after him). He
asked, "Aren't you the master of Mt.T'ou Tzu?" T'ou Tzu said,
"I beg you for a coin for the tea and salt tax." Chao Chou then
went up onto Mt.T'ou Tzu first and sat there in his hut, (wait­
ing for T'ou Tzu to return.) Later T'ou Tzu returned to his her­
mitage, bringing along a jar of oil. Chao Chou said, "I've long
heard of T'ou Tzu, but now that I've come here I just see an old
man selling oil." T'ou Tzu said, "You just see an old man sell­
ing oil, but you don't know T'ou Tzu." Chao Chou said, "What
is T'ou Tzu?" T'ou Tzu said, "Oily oil." Chao Chou said, "How
is it when gaining life amidst death?" T'ou Tzu said, "One must
not go by night; one must get there by daylight." Chao Chou
said, "I'm a swindler, yet you swindled me."
Henceforward T'ou Tzu's Path was heard of all over the coun­
try, and "cloud and rain " folk (traveling Ch'an students) flocked
to him. The master told the assembly, "All of you have come
here trying to find fresh new sayings and beautiful verses.I am
an old man whose strength has dwindled, my way of talking is
slow and blunt. If you question me, I'll follow you and give
my reply. I have no hidden marvels that can be conveyed to
you....Here there is nothing that can be given to you, there is
no outside or inside that can be related to you. Do all of you
realize this?" ...The master lived on Mt. T'ou Tzu for over
thirty years.He dealt with and aroused those who came seek­
ing instruction who constantly filled his room.

The Huang Chao revolt broke out in 881 and there was
chaos throughout the country. A madman came up the moun­
tain carrying a blade; he asked T'ou Tzu what he was living
there for, so the master expounded the Dharma in accordance
with the situation to the man. When he heard this, the man
bowed and submitted; then he stripped off his clothes and gave
them to T'ou Tzu and went away.
In 914 the master showed a slight illness: the congregation
wanted to call a doctor, but the master told them, "The ac­
tivity of the four elements is a continual process of assembly
and dissolution. Don't you worry: I'll preserve myself." When
he finished talking, he sat cross-legged and died.

LAYMAN P'ANG
CASE

(8-9 cent.)

(Layman P'ang succeeded to both Shih T'ou and Ma Tsu, the
foremost teachers of the eighth century. He had been a minor
civil official, but later he took all his wealth and sank it in a
river. His family of a wife, son, and daughter split up, and he
went from place to place with his daughter, weaving bamboo
baskets and selling them to make a living. In his travels he vis­
ited many of the Ch'an masters who had succeeded to Ma Tsu.
The following account is excerpted from Ching Te Ch'uan

Teng Lu 8)
His name was Tao Hsuan: in the world, Confucianism was
his business; yet the layman somewhat understood the toil of
passion, and aspired to seek the real truth. In the latter 780's he
visited Master Shih T'ou; he forgot the words and compre­
hended the inner meaning. He also was a friend of Ch'an Mas­
ter Tan Hsia (a successor of Shih T'ou).
One day Shih T'ou asked him, "Since you've seen me, how
are your daily affairs?" He responded, "If you ask about my
daily affairs, I have no way to open my mouth." He also pre­
sented a verse which said,

In my daily affairs there's nothing different;
Only I myself am in harmony.
Nothing do I grasp or reject,
Nowhere do I insist or turn away.

Shih T'ou approved of this; he said, "Will you be a monk or a
layman?" The layman said, "I want to follow my wish, " and
after all did not shave his head or wear the dark (garment of
a monk).
Later he went to Kiangsi and asked Ma Tsu, "Who is he who
is not the companion of myriad things?" Tsu said, "When you
swallow all the water of the West River in one gulp, then I'll
tell you." At these words the layman suddenly apprehended the
abstruse essence; subsequently he stayed to learn for two years.
He had a verse which said,

I have a son who does not marry
And a daughter who does not wed:
The whole family gathered 'round,
Together we speak birthless talk.

Henceforth his eloquence was swift; he was heard of every­
where....He had three hundred and more poems which cir­
culated in the world.

LIANG CHIEH
CASE

of Tung Shan (806-869)

(The following account is taken from Wu Teng Hui Yuan 13)
In youth he followed a teacher and recited the Perfection of
Wisdom Heart Sutra; coming to where it says, 'There is no eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind,' he suddenly felt his face and
asked the teacher, "I have eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and so forth;
why does the sutra say there are none?" The teacher was sur­
prised at this and said, "I am not your teacher." Then he di­
rected him to go to Mt. Wu Hsieh (in Chekiang) to pay obei­
sance to Ch'an master (Ling) Mo (746-818; reckoned as one of
Ma Tsu's successors, he was actually enlightened under Shih
T'ou and was his attendant for twenty years), by whom he had
his head shaved.At twenty-one he went to Sung Shan and re­
ceived the precepts in full.

612

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

Travelling around, he first called on Nan Ch'uan; as it hap­
pened, it was the anniversary of Ma Tsu's death, so they were
preparing a ceremonial feast. Ch'uan asked the community,
"Tomorrow we will set out a feast forMa Tsu; do you thinkMa
Tsu will come, or not?" No one replied; the master (Tung Shan)
came forth and answered, "If he has a companion, he'll come."
Ch'uan said, "Though this lad is young, he is quite suitable for
carving and polishing." The master said, "Teacher, don't op­
press a freeman (Liang, Tung Shan's personal name) and make
him a slave." (The Tsu Tang Chi says that after this he began
to be known as an adept.)
Next he called on Kuei Shan and asked, "I recently have
heard that the National Teacher Chung of Nan Yang had a say­
ing about inanimate objects expounding the Dharma, but I
have not thoroughly comprehended its subtlety." Kuei Shan
said, "Do y ou not remember it?" The master said, "I remem­
ber." Kuei Shan said, "Try to recite it for me." The master then
recited, "A monk asked, 'What is the mind of an ancient Bud­
dha?' The National Teacher said, 'Walls, tiles, and pebbles.'
The monk said, 'Aren't walls, tiles, and pebbles inanimate?'
The National Teacher said, 'That's right.' The monk said, 'And
can they expound the Dharma, or not?' The National Teacher
said, 'They are always expounding it clearly, without inter­
ruption.' The monk said, 'Why don't I hear it?' The National
Teacher said, 'You yourself don't hear it, but you shouldn't
hinder the one who does hear it.' The monk said, 'Who can
hear it?' The National Teacher said, 'All the saints can hear it.'
The monk said, 'Can you hear it too, Master?' The National
Teacher said, 'I don't hear it.' The monk said, 'Since you don't
hear it, how do you know that inanimate objects can expound
the Dharma?' The National Teacher said, 'It's lucky I don't hear
it; if I heard it, then I'd be equal to the saints and you wouldn't
hear me expound the Dharma.' The monk said, 'Then sentient
beings have no part in it.' The National Teacher said, 'I ex­
plain for sentient beings, not for the saints.' The monk said,
'How are sentient beings after they have heard it?' The Na­
tional Teacher said, 'Then they are not sentient beings.' The
monk said, 'What scripture is the "inanimate expounding the
Dharma" based on?' The National Teacher said, 'Obviously if
the words do not accord with the classics, it is not the talk of a
gentleman: you have not read how the Avatamsaka Sutra says,

Biographies

613

"Lands expound it, sentient beings expound it, everything in
the three times expounds it"?"'
When the master had finished reciting, Kuei Shan said, "I
too have something here, but a suitable man is hard to come
across." The master said, "I'm still not clear; please point it out
to me." Kuei Shan raised his whisk and said, "Do you under­
stand?" The master said, "I don't understand. Please explain."
Kuei Shan said, "The mouth born of my father and mother will
never explain it to you." The master said, "Is there another
who sought the Way in the same time as you?" Kuei Shan said,
"From here go to Yu district in Li Leng, to where there is a row
of stone grottoes; there is a man of the Way there, Y un Yen;
if you can pull out the weeds to find his way, he will be of value
to you." The master said, "How is this man?" Kuei Shan said,
"He once asked me, 'When I want to serve you, how can I do
so?' I told him, 'You must just absolutely cut off all leakage be­
fore you can.' He said, 'And would I be able to not go against
your teaching or not?' I said, 'Above all, don't say that I'm
here.'"
The master took leave of Kuei Shan and went right to Y un
Yen; having quoted the preceding incident, he asked, "Who can
hear inanimate objects expounding the Dharma?" Y un Yen
said, "The inanimate can hear it." The master said, "Can you
hear it, teacher?" Y un Yen said, "If I heard, you would not
hear my expounding of the Dharma." The master said, "Why
wouldn't I hear?" Yen raised his whisk and said, "Do you
hear?" The master said, "No." Yen said, "You do not even hear
my expounding of the Dharma; how could you hear the inani­
mate expounding the Dharma?" The master said, "What scrip­
ture contains the inanimate expounding the Dharma?" Yen
said, "Haven't you read how the Amitabha Sutra says, 'Riv­
ers, birds, trees, and forests all commemorate Buddha and
Dharma."' At this the master had insight; thereupon he ut­
tered a verse:

How wonderful! How wonderful!
The inanimate expounding of Dharma is
inconceivable;
If you use your ears to listen, you'll never
understandOnly when you hear in your eyes will you know.

614

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

The master asked Y un Yen, "I have leftover habits which are
not yet exhausted." Y un Yen said, "What have you ever done?"
The master said, "I have not even practiced the holy truths."
Yen said, "And do you rejoice, or not?" The master said, "I am
not without joy; it is like finding a bright jewel in a dung­
heap."
When he was about to go, he asked Y un Yen, "After your
death, if someone should suddenly ask me if I can depict your
true likeness, how shall I answer?" Yen remained silent for a
good while, then said, "Just this is it." The master was sunk in
contemplation; Yen said, "Reverend Chieh, now that you have
taken up this matter, you must be very careful and thorough­
going."
The master still had some doubt; later, as he was crossing a
river, he saw his reflection and was greatly awakened to the
inner meaning of what had happened before. He made a verse
which said,
Just avoid seeking from others,
Or you will be far estranged from yourself.
I now go on alone; I meet Him everywhere­
He is now just I, but I now am not He:
One must understand in this way
In order to unite with thusness.

From the end of the Ta Chung era (847-859) of T'ang, the
master received and guided students at Hsin Feng Mountain;
after this, he caused the teaching to flourish at Tung Mountain
(Tung Shan) in Kao An in Y u Chiang (in Kiangsi). He provi­
sionally opened up the five ranks, and skillfully handled the
three potentials (high, middling, low); he greatly opened up the
One Sound, and widely spread it through the myriad classes.
He drew his precious sword sideways and cut off the forest of
various views: his wondrous harmony spread widely, cutting
off myriad rationalizations.
He also found Ts'ao Shan, who was deeply enlightened into
the real essence, and wonderfully extolled the felicitous way,
the harmony of the ways of lord and vassal, biased and true
interdepending. Because of this the mystic breeze of the Tung
succession spread throughout the land. Therefore, the masters
of Ch'an everywhere all esteemed it and called it the Ts'ao­
Tung Sect.

615

(Tung Shan had twenty-six successors; among them, Tao
Ying of Yun Chu (d. 903) was one of the greatest masters of
the time, who led a community of fifteen hundred people and
produced twenty-eight enlightened disciples. Su Shan K'uang
Jen (n.d.) was another distinguished successor to Tung Shan,
with twenty enlightened disciples. The most enduring line
of the Tung succession was that which came down through
Yun Chu; he and Hsueh Feng, who is said to have called on
Tung Shan nine times, were the foremost masters of their
age in southeastern and southern China. The Ts'ao Tung sect
trickled down in China until the seventeenth century; it was
transmitted to Japan in the thirteenth century, over three hun­
dred years after the founders, and still continues there in a
modified form until present times.)

(The following is from the Ching Te Ch 'uan Teng Lu 17)
The master was a man from Fu Chou; his surname was Wu.
At age seven he left home under the Great Master Hsueh Feng;
when he came of age he was ordained.
The master travelled around till he come to Chiin Yang and
visited Chiu Feng. Feng permitted the master to enter his pri­
vate room. One day Feng said to him, "You have come from far,
far away to join the assembly. Have you seen any realm that
can be cultivated? What shortcut can you get out by?" The
master replied, "In the dark empty clearing, the blind are blind
of themselves." At first Chiu Feng didn't approve: because of
this the master discovered his intent and suddenly forgot his
knowledge and views.
Previously the master had received an invitation to stay at
Great Wisdom Temple on Ho Shan in Chi Chou (in Kiangsi).
There students flocked around him. The master imparted ten
booklets of admonitions which were received joyously all over.
All said that Ho Shan was a suitable standard for the commu­
nities of monks.
Around this time the Li Clan (in power) south of the (Yangtse)
River summoned the master. He was asked, "Where have you
come from, Teacher?" The master said, "From Ho Shan."

"Where is the mountain?" The master said, "The man has come
for an audience at the Imperial Palace, but the mountain has
never moved." The Lord esteemed him and ordered him to dwell
at Lucky Light Temple in Yang Chou. The master requested (to
be allowed) to go back into the mountains.
In 960 the master showed a slight illness. He ordered his at­
tendants to open up the abbot's quarters and assemble everyone
there. He bade them farewell saying, "Hereafter students won't
know Ho Shan: better get acquainted right now. Take care of
yourselves!"

(The following account is from Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu 23)
He received the seal and testimonial of Lo Shan (a successor
of Yen T'ou). He did not linger in one corner (but) powerfully
extolled the mystic teaching. All the elders were in awe of his
genius; there were rarely any latecoming students who dared
to confront his 'swordpoint.'
When the master was in the great hall of Chao Ch'ing in
Ch'uan Chou (in Fukien), he pointed to a wall painting and
asked a monk, "What spirit is that?" (The monk) said, "The
good spirit who guards the Dharma." The master said, "Where
did it go at the time of the persecution?" The monk had
no reply.
The master then had the monk go ask attendant Yen. Yen
said, "In what aeon did you meet with this calamity?" The
monk returned and quoted this to the master; the master said,
"Even if attendant Yen later on gathers a following of a thou­
sand people, what would be the use?" The monk then bowed
and asked the master for an alternate saying; the master said,
"Where did it go?"
Elder Ch'ing brought up the story of Yang Shan sticking the
hoe in the ground and asked the master, "Was the Ancient's
meaning where he folded his hands, or is the meaning where he
stuck the hoe in the ground?" The master said, "Elder Ch'ing!"
Ch'ing responded; the master said, "Have you ever seen Yang
Shan even in a dream?" Ch'ing said, "I don't want a comment; I
just want you to discuss it." The master said, "If you want dis­
cussion, there are fifteen hundred old teachers in the hall."

The master came to Shuang Yen; the elder of Shuang Yen ob­
served the master's appearance, then said, "I will pose a ques­
tion to ask you; if you can speak, then I will abandon this
temple; if you cannot speak, then I won't abandon it. The
Diamond Sutra says, 'All Buddhas and all the Buddhas' teach­
ings come forth from this sutra.' Tell me, who expounds this
sutra?" The master said, "Putting 'expounding' and 'not ex­
pounding' aside for the moment, just what do you call 'this
sutra'?" Shuang Yen had no reply. The master cited the sutra,
saying, "All wise ones and sages rely on the uncontrived way,
yet there are distinctions; this is because the uncontrived way
is the ultimate law-on what basis are there distinctions? But
are distinctions faults or not? If they're faults, all wise ones and
sages have faults; if they're not faults, just what is to be called
'distinctions'?" Shuang Yen again had nothing to say. The mas­
ter said, "What Hsueh Feng said."
When the master was in Chih Che temple in Wu Chou (in
Chekiang), he sat in the first seat (as a 'head monk'). He never
would take clean water. The monk who was superintendent of
affairs asked him, "Why are you not conscious of defilement,
that you won't take clean water?" The master got down from
the platform, picked up the pure water pitcher, and said, "This
is pure." The superintendent said nothing; the master then
broke the water pitcher. Henceforth the master's repute in the
Way spread afar.
The congregation on Mt. Ming Chou (also in Wu Chou,
Chekiang) asked him to abide there and open up the teaching.
Ch'an folk from all quarters filled the halls and rooms.
Someone asked, "Who can face the smokeless fire?"
The master said, "One who isn't anxious for his eyebrows."
He asked, "Can you face it, Master?"
The master said, "Tell me, how many eyebrow hairs do I
have left?"
A certain monk who had been in the master's audience took

his leave and went to live in a hut for a year. Later he came back
and paid obeisance; he said, "A man of old said 'If you haven't
met for three days, do not look upon someone as before." The
master then exposed his chest and said, "Tell me, how many
hairs do I have on my chest?" The monk had no reply. The mas­
ter then asked, "When did you leave your hut?" He said, "This
morning." The master said, "When you came, to whom did you

Feng: see Cases 5, 21, and 51. T he following account is from
the

Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu 16.)

T he master was a man of Ch'uan Chou (in Hopei); his sur­
name was K'o. In his youth he paid homage to Master Yi of
(the district town) Ch'ing Yuan and had his head shaved. He
went to Pao Shou Temple in (the capital) Ch'ang An and was
ordained. He studied all the sections of the Sutras and Vinaya
Texts.
Yen T'ou made the rounds of the Ch'an monasteries with
Hsueh Feng I T s'un and Ch'in Shan Wen Sui as his compan­
ions. From Mt. Ta Tz'u in Yi.i Hang he made his way to Lin
Chi, but it was just after Lin Chi himself had died. T hen he vis­
ited Yang Shan. As soon as he entered the gate, Yen T'ou picked
up his sitting mat and said, "Teacher!" Yang Shan took his
whisk and made as if to hold it up. T'ou said, "An undeni­
able expert."
Later Yen T'ou called on Te Shan: holding his sitting mat, he
went into the Dharma Hall and looked up (at Te Shan). Te Shan
said, "Well?" T'ou snorted at him. Shan said, "Where was my
fault?" T'ou said, "A doubled case," then left the hall. Shan
said, "T his master looks a little like a foot-travelling man."
T he next day when Yen T'ou went up to inquire after him, Te
Shan said, "Didn't you just arrive here yesterday, Reverend?"
T'ou said, "T hat's right." Shan said, "Where did you learn this
empty-headedness?" T'ou said, "I never deceive myself." Shan
said, "After this you shouldn't turn your back on me." Another
time Yen T'ou went to visit Te Shan: entering the abbot's quar­
ters, T'ou contorted his body and asked, "Ordinary or sage?" Te
Shan shouted, and Yen T'ou bowed in homage. (Further inci­
dents involving Yen T'ou, Hsueh Feng and Te Shan are con­

Yen T 'ou said, "T he intent of my teaching is like a poison­
smeared drum: one beat and all who hear it, near and far,
perish."
Later whenever anyone asked about Buddha, asked about
Dharma, asked about Tao, or asked about Ch'an, Yen T 'ou
would always sigh.
During the 880's the central plain (i.e., the area around the
capital, the heart of the realm) was infested with plundering ar­
mies: the master's congregation all fled the area. Yen T 'ou him­
self (remained) sitting solemn and calm. One day bandits came
in force. Accusing the master of not offering them any gifts,
they slashed him with their blades. His countenance calm and
collected, the master gave a loud shout, then died. T he sound
could be heard for several dozen miles.

(T he following is from the Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu 14)
He was originally from Hai Hun in Yii Chang (modern Nan

instruction from Master Nie'h-p'an and was ordained. He
joined Yao Shan's Dharma assembly and gained intimate ac­
cord with the Mind Seal. One day Yao Shan asked him, "Where
are you coming from?" Tao Wu said, "From wandering in the
mountains." Yao Shan said, "Speak quickly without leaving
from this room." Tao Wu said, "T he ravens on the mountain
are white as snow; the fish swimming in the pond are hurrying
ceaseless! y."
Tao Wu and Y un Yen were attending Yao Shan. Yao Shan
said, "Better not speak where your wisdom doesn't reach. If
you do, then horns spout on your head. What about it, Ascetic
Chih?" Tao Wu immediately left. Yun Yen asked Yao Shan,
"Why did Elder Brother Chih not answer you, Teacher?" Yao
Shan said, "I have a back ache today-(despite his leaving,) he
does understand: go ask him." Y un Yen immediately went and
asked Tao Wu, "Why didn't you reply to our Teacher, Elder
Brother?" Tao Wu said, "Go back and ask our Teacher."
When Y un Yen was about to die, he sent someone to deliver
his farewell letter to Tao Wu. Tao Wu opened it, glanced through

it and said, "Y un Yen knows no shame: I shouldn't have spoken
to him that time. Nevertheless, in essence he was a (faithful)
'son' who didn't go against Yao Shan."
Y un Yen asked, "What is your family style, Elder Brother?"
Tao Wu said, "What would be the use of having you point
it out?"
(Ho was asked,) "What is the place to apply effort in these
times?" Tao Wu said, "If a thousand people call you, and you
don't turn your head, only then will you have some small por­
tion (of attainment.)"
He was asked, "What is your family style, Teacher?" Tao
Wu got down from the meditation seat and curtseyed saying,
"Thanks for coming from so far away."
In 835 Tao Wu showed sickness: he was in pain. T he monks
of his congregation came to offer condolences and inquire
about his health. Tao Wu said, "There is an experience which
is not repaid: do you realize that?" The congregation were all
sorrowful. When he was about to go, Tao Wu said to them. "I
am crossing over to the west, but Principle has no eastward
movement." As he finished speaking, he showed the stillness
of death.

He was originally from Hsin Kan inLuLing (in Kiangsi); his
surname was Ch'en. At age thirteen he had his head shaved by
Ch'an Master ShaoLuan; at twenty-three he was fully ordained
on (the holy mountain) Sung Yueh.
The master came to the Dharma assembly on Mt. Kuei:
there he served as the rice steward. One day he was in the rice
room sieving rice, when Kuei Shan said to him, "You shouldn't
throw away what the donor gave us." Shih Shuang said, "I'm
not throwing anything away." Kuei Shan picked up a grain of
rice off the floor and said, "You said you didn't throw anything
away: where did this come from?" Shih Shuang had no reply.
Kuei Shan also said, "Don't slight this one grain of rice: a

hundred thousand grains are born from this one grain." Shih
Shuang said, "A hundred thousand grains arise from this one
grain, but where does this one grain come from?" Kuei Shan
laughed loudly and returned to his abbot's quarters. T hat night
he went up to the hall and said, "(Attention) everybody! T here's
a worm in the rice."
Later Shih Shuang studied with Tao Wu. He asked, "What
is enlightenment right before the eyes?" Tao Wu called to a
novice, and the novice responded. Wu said, "Fill the water
pitcher." Wu then asked Shih Shuang, "What did you just
ask?" Shuang then repeated his question. Wu immediately got
up and left. From this Shuang had an awakening. Tao Wu said,
"I'm sick: I am about to leave the world. I have something on
my mind that has been bothering me for a long time-who can
clear it up?" Shuang said, "Mind and things are both wrong;
trying to clear them away increases the affliction." Tao Wu
said, "How sage!"
In order to shun the world, the master mixed with lay people
in the Liu Yang Pottery works in Ch'ang Sha. In the mornings
he wandered, in the evenings he rested. No one could become
acquainted with him. Later, because Tung Shan Liang Chieh
sent a monk to search him out, his talents began to be revealed,
and he was chosen to reside on Shih Shuang Shan ("Stone Frost
Mountain.") Later when Tao Wu was about to abandon his con­
gregation and die, he considered Shih Shuang his true suc­
cessor, and personally went to Shih Shuang to be near him.
Shih Shuang served him scrupulously, with all the etiquette
due a teacher. After a while Tao Wu died, and disciples flocked
to Shih Shuang, forming a congregation of five hundred.
A monk asked, "What is the meaning of the coming from
the West?" The master said, "A piece of rock in empty space."
W hen the monk bowed, the master said, "Do you understand?"
The monk said, "I don't understand." T he master said, "Luck­
ily you don't understand. If you did it would have smashed
your head."
The master stayed at Shih Shuang for twenty years' time.
His students always sat, they never lay down. All over the
country they were known as the "dead tree congregation." The
T'ang emperor Hsi Tsung heard of the fame of the master's
Path and sent emissaries to bestow purple robes on him. The

WEN SUI of Ch'in Shan
CASE

56

(The following is from the Ching Te Ch'uan Teng Lu

17)

The master was originally from Fu Chou. While still young
he was ordained by Ch'an Master Huan Chung at the Temple
of Great Compassion in Hang Chou. At the time Yen T'ou and
Hsueh Feng were in the congregation: when they saw Ch'in
Shan express his opinions, they knew he was a vessel of the
Dharma. They took him along with them as they went travel­
ling. The affinities of these two worthies meshed with Te Shan:
each received his seal; but though Ch'in Shan was aroused
many times, in the end he was still frozen and stuck. One day
he asked Te Shan, "T'ien Huang spoke this way; Lung T'an
spoke this way; (Lung T'an was Te Shan's master; T'ien Huang
was Lung T'an's) I wonder, how does Te Shan speak?" Te Shan
said, "Try to cite what T'ien Huang and Lung T'an said." As
Ch'in Shan was about to put forward some words, Te Shan
herded him into the Nirvana Hall (i.e., the infirmary). Ch'in
Shan said, "You may be right, but you beat me too much."
Later Ch'in Shan awoke at Tung Shan's words: hence he was
Tung Shan's successor. At age twenty-seven he settled at Ch'in
Shan. To his congregation he related that when he first visited
Tung Shan, Tung Shan asked, "Where did you come here from?"
The master said, "From Great Compassion." Tung Shan said,
"And did you see the master of Great Compassion?" The mas­
ter said, "I did." Tung Shan said, "Did you see him before form
or after form?" The master said, "It was not seeing before or
after." Tung Shan was silent, so the master then said, "Hav­
ing left my master too soon, I didn't get to the bottom of his
meaning."
A monk asked, "What is the meaning of the coming from
the West?" Ch'in Shan said, "The Lord of Liang's (Emperor
Wu's) T-square, Master Chih's cutting knife."
A monk asked, "What is your family style, Teacher?" The
master said, "Brocade curtains and a silver incense box: when

the wind blows, the whole road is filled with perfume." An­
other monk asked, "How do you teach people, Teacher?" The
master said, "If I taught people, I'd be the same as you lot." The
monk said, "I've come especially to visit you, Teacher: you
should reveal the style of the sect. The master said, "If you
came specially, I'll have to." The monk said, "Please do." The
master then struck him. The monk was speechless. Ch'in Shan
said, "You're guarding a stump, waiting for a rabbit,

MAHASATTVA FU

Mahasattva Fu, also called Shan Hui, was a layman and a small
farmer; in his middle twenties he retired to a mountain with
his wife and two children, where he worked during the day and
practiced the Way at night. In the course of time he gave up all
of his possessions three times, sold his wife and children, and
hired himself out as a laborer, spending the proceeds to feed the
poor and hungry. Throughout his life he continued to work, as­
sisted by his family (who, out of respect for the Mahasattva,
were not actually enslaved by their purchasers) and disciples;
he fasted and gave the food saved thereby to the needy. The
time during which he lived was especially bitter for great masses
of peasants, and Mahasattva Fu is exemplary for his continued
generosity in almsgiving, not only of Dharma, but also of mate­
rial goods. He went into the capital of Liang several times to
preach, hoping to spread the Dharma more widely than was
possible from his mountain abode. The following is a summary
of three levels of goodness, to which Fu enjoined Emperor W u
o f Liang i n his first letter t o the monarch:
The highest good has an empty heart as its basis,
and non-attachment as its source; abolishment of
formality is the cause, and nirvana is the result.

The middling good has government of oneself as its

have all

high great men were not the same as the common sort. Right
now, if you can't establish yourself independently, you're wast­

one to take your place, nor is there any way for you to use your
minds. Don't go to others to seek. Since you've always just relied
on others to understand, when they spoke you always got stuck.
The fact that your light doesn't penetrate through is just be­
cause there are things before your eyes."
A monk asked, "What is the hidden meaning?" The master
said, "There is no one who can understand." "What is turning
towards it?" The master said, "If there is turning towards, this
immediately goes against it." "What is not turning towards
it?" The master said, "Who is looking for the hidden mean­

your mind." The monk said, "How is it you have no expedient
means to enable this student to gain entry?" The master said,
"The Sound-Seer's

drawing a sword. The master said, "Too late."
The master went up into the Hall and said, "Today I'm going
to talk Ch'an: all of you come closer." Everyone approached,
and the master said, "Listen to Kuanyin's conduct, respond­

Kuanyin's conduct?" The master then snapped his fingers and
said, "Do all of you hear or not?" The monks said, "We hear."

Ch'an Master Hai of Pai Chang, but he did not awaken to his
mystic meaning. After he had served Pai Chang for around
twenty years, Pai Chang died so Y un Yen visited Yao Shan and
reached understanding there at his words.... Later the master
dwelt at Y un Yen Shan ("Cloud Cliff Mountain ") in T'an Chou
(in Hunan).
One day Y un Yen told the assembly, "There's a son of some­
one's family-when questioned, there is nothing he cannot ex­
plain." Tung Shan asked, "How many scriptures were there in
his house?" The master said, "Not even a single word." "Then
how did he get so much knowledge?" The master said, "Day
and night he never slept." "Could I still ask him about some­
thing?" The master said, "If he could say, he wouldn't say."
Once when Y un Yen was sweeping the floor, Kuei Shan said
to him, "Too busy!" The master said, "You should know that
there's one who isn't busy." Kuei Shan said, "If so, then there's
a second moon." The master held up his broom and said "Which
moon is this?" Kuei Shan lowered his head and left. When
Hsuan Sha heard of this he said, "Precisely the second moon."
Once when Y un Yen was making shoes, Tung Shan asked,
"If I come to you, Master, and ask for eyes, I wonder, will I get
them or not?" Y un Yen said, "Who did you give yours to?"
Tung Shan said, "I haven't got any." The master said, "If you
had, where would you put them?" Tung Shan was speechless.

The master was originally from Ch'ien Hua; his surname
was Liao.From age eight he followed a teacher; at twenty-five
he was fully ordained.Someone who met him noticed his spe­
cial appearance and said to him, "Your mettle is not common­
place: you ought to be the Dharma King's helper." So the master
went to Buddha's Footprint Range to visit Ma Tsu and pay his
respects. There he entered Ma Tsu's room along with Ch'an
Master Hai of Pai Chang: both received Ma Tsu's seal.
One day Ma Tsu sent the master to Ch'ang An to present a
book to National Teacher Chung.The National Teacher asked,
"What Dharma does your master expound?" Hsi T'ang crossed
from east to west and stood there.The National Teacher said,
"What else is there besides just this?" The master recrossed to
the east and stood there. The National Teacher said, "This
is Ma Tsu's; what about you, good man?" The master said,
"There's already been a showing for you, Teacher."
Hsi T'ang returned to his native district: he had received Ma
Tsu's patched robe.... One day Ma Tsu asked him, "Why
don't you read sutras?" The master said, "Could sutras be any
different (from this)?" Ma Tsu said, "Though this is so, later on
you'll still have to help people." The master said, "I am sick
and want to heal myself: how could I dare to speak for others?"
Ma Tsu said, "In your last years you will inevitably (cause the
Dharma to) flourish in the world." After Ma Tsu had died,
the congregation in 791 asked the master to open the hall
(and teach).

When young, the master studied Confucianism; later he
entered the Buddhist order, and went to study under the re­
knowned P'u Chi (who was known as the Seventh Patriarch in
the northern Ch'an tradition; his master had been Shen Hsiu,
one of the Fifth Patriarch Hung Jen's ten great disciples). There
he was enlighted in Ch'an; later he came to Great Elephant
Peak in the mountains of central China, where he sat alone
peacefully in deep nirvanic stillness for several years. Students
came seeking him out and gathered around him; eventually Li
T'ao Ying, military commander of Hui Cou and member of the
imperial clan, ordered him to come to the city; but Shih Tsang
refused, saying that his rustic nature was impossible to bridle,
and he couldn't be bothered with rules of etiquette. Li then
climbed the mountain himself to talk to the Master; after­

Next the master went travelling to look over the various
localities (where Ch'an flourished). For three years he lived
on Mt. T'ien T'ai's Flower Top Peak.He went to Hang Chou's
Ching Shan and payed his respects to Ch'an Master Kuo I. In
the middle of the Y uan Ho years

(806-821)

he went to the

Dragon Gate (Mountain's) Fragrant Mountain near Loyang,
where he and Master Fu Niu were faithful friends....He also
visited National Teacher Chung....
(One day during the year) 809 the master stretched out on
T'ien Chin Bridge.When the governor, Lord Cheng, appeared,
the master reviled him and didn't get up.One of the governor's
attendants asked him his reason for doing this. The master
took his time about answering and said, "(Because I am) an un­
concerned monk." The governor considered him extraordinary
and offered him clothes and daily provisions of food. In the
spring of his fifteenth year (in Loyang) the master announced to
his disciples, "I've been thinking of a place with forests and
streams in which to die." Soon his disciples had a geomancer
(pick a site for) a hermitage to be built on Tan Hsia Mountain in
Nan Yang.Within three years time (after the master had taken
up residence there) students of the mystery had gathered, form­
ing a congregation of three hundred, so they built a monastery.

(Yeo Shan was a successor to Shih T'ou and the ancestor of the
Ts'ao-Tung School. The following comes from the Te Ching
Ch'uan Teng Lu 14:)
Ch'an Master Wei Yen of Yao Shan in Li Chou (in Hunan)
was a man from Chiang Chou (in Shansi); his surname was
Han.He left home at age seventeen and was ordained in 774 on
Heng Yueh by the Vinaya Master Hsi Ts'ao.
As soon as he visited Shih T'ou, the master intimately com­
prehended his esoteric message.One day as the master was sit­
ting, Shih T'ou saw him and asked, "What are you doing here?"

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

The master said, "I'm not doing anything at all." Shih T'ou
said, "If so then you're sitting idly." The master said, "If I were
sitting idly, that would be doing something." Shih T'ou said,
"You speak of not doing: not doing what?" The master said,
"Even the thousand sages do not know." Shih T'ou praised him
with a verse:
Since we've lived together I haven't known your
name.
Doing as you please, acting this way, bringing me
alongEven the sages of high antiquity don't know:
How could the hurried common type be able to
understand.
Shih T'ou once said, "Speech and action have nothing to do
with it." The master said, "Not speaking and non-action don't
have anything to do with it either." Shih T'ou said, "Here, not
even a needle can enter." The master said, "Here, it's like grow·
ing flowers on stone." Shih T'ou approved of him. Later the
master dwelt on Yao Shan in Li Chou: an oceanlike congrega·
tion gathered.
A monk asked, "How can one not be confused by all phe­
nomena?" The master said, "If you go along with them, how
can they obstruct you?" The monk said, "I don't understand."
The master said, "What phenomena are confusing you?"
A monk asked, "What is nirvana�" The master said, "What
did you call it before you opened your mouth?"
A monk asked, "I have not yet understood my own thing:
please, Teacher, point it out to me." After a silence the master
said, "It wouldn't be hard for me to say something for you right
now: it would only be proper if you immediately saw at my
words-then you'd have gotten somewhere. But if you kept on
entering into calculating thought, it would become my fault.
It's not as good as both of us shutting up to avoid entangling
each other."
As Yao Shan was about to die he cried out, "The Dharma
Hall is collapsing! The Dharma Hall is collapsing! Everybody
prop it up!" Then he raised his hand and said, "You disciples
don't understand my meaning," and died.

CH 'IAN of Yen Kuan (District's) Chen Kuo
Hai Ch'ang Temple
CASE

91

(The following is taken from the Ching Te Ch 'uan Teng Lu

7: )

Yen Kuan was originally from Hai Men District (in Che­
kiang); his surname was Li. When he was born a spiritual light
filled the room. Also, there was a strange monk who told him,
"Will y ou not be the one who will establish the supreme ban­
ner and make the Buddha-sun shine back?" So he had his head
shaved and was ordained by Ch'an Master Y un Tsung of his na­
tive district. Later he heard that Ma Tsu was teaching on Kung
Kung Mountain, so he took his staff and went to visit him
there. Yen Kuan had an extraordinary appearance: as soon as
Ma Tsu saw him he considered him a profound vessel, so he
ordered him to come into his room and intimately instructed
him in the Correct Dharma.
A monk asked Yen Kuan, "What is one's own Vairocana Bud­
dha?" The master said, "Bring me that brass pitcher." The
monk then brought the pitcher over. The master said, "Take it
back and put it where it was." Having returned the pitcher
to its place, this monk came back to ask again about his previ­
ous question. Yen Kuan said, "The ancient Buddha is indeed
long gone!"
A lecturing monk came calling. The master asked him,
"What is y our work?" The lecturer said, "I lecture on the Hua
Yen sutra." The master said, "How many kinds of dharma
worlds are there in the sutra?" The lecturer answered, "To ex­
plain fully, there are many many, without end; to explain briefly,
there are four kinds." The master held up his whisk and said,
"Which kind of dharma world is this?" The lecturer sank into
thought as he slowly pondered his reply. The master said, "To
know by pondering, to understand by thinking it over-this is
the way ghosts make their living. Sure enough, the lone lamp
beneath the sun loses its glow."
A monk asked Ta Mei, "What is the meaning of the coming
from the West?" Ta Mei said, "The coming from the West has
no meaning." When Yen Kuan heard of this he said, "One cof­
fin, two corpses."
Later, without illness, Yen Kuan sat peacefully and died.

CHU HUI of Ta Kuang (836-903)
CASE

93

(The following is taken from the account in the Ching Te

Ch'uan Teng Lu 16:)
The master was a man from the capital district (Ch'ang An);
his surname was Wang.
When he first visited the room of Shih Shuang (his master)
he passed two years staying close by, asking for instruction.He
was ordered to take charge of the North Stupa.With clothes
of hemp and shoes of straw, he was on the verge of forgetting
his body and consciousness. One day Shih Shuang, intending
to test what Ta Kuang had attained, questioned him saying,
"Every year the country sends its chosen candidates to com­
pete in the examinations: do they get posts at court or not?"
The master said, "There are people who do not seek advance­
ment." Shih Shuang said, "Why?" The master said, "Because
they do not act for the sake of fame." While he was ill, Shih
Shuang again questioned the master, "Is there any other time
besides Today?" The master said, "I don't even say Today is
right." Shih Shuang approved of him very much.... The mas­
ter stayed in the vicinity (of Shih Shuang) for over twenty years.
The benefactor of Buddhism, Lord Hu of Liu Yang (in Hunan),
invited the master to reside on Mt. Ta Kuang, in order to propa­
gate the teachings of the sect.
There was a monk who asked, "As for Bodhidharma, was he
a Patriarch or not?" Ta Kuang said, "He wasn't a Patriarch."
The monk said, "Since he wasn't a Patriarch, what did he come
for?" The master said, "Because you wouldn't comprehend a
Patriarch." The monk asked, "What's it like after comprehend­
ing?" The master said, "You finally know he wasn't a Patriarch."
The master was asked, "What was it like during the primor­
dial chaos, before differentiation?" The master said, "Who can
relate the Teachings of the Age?" The master also said, "The
Teachings of the Age were just to straighten out the people of
the age.Even if you can cut all the way through them, this is
just becoming a person who has finished his task.You shouldn't
then take this as the business of patchrobed ones." Thus it is
said, "In forty-nine years Buddha couldn't explain it fully; in
forty-nine years he couldn't wrap it all up." Whenever Ta Kuang
taught students it was generally like this.

THE THREE ROADS OF TUNG SHAN

(The following explanation is taken from Shigetsu Ein's
Funogo san ro, da, shi i rui, a 'Non-talk on the three roads,

(three) falls, and four different kinds' (1761). Shigetsu was a
Soto Zen master, a Japanese descendant of Ts'ao-Tung Ch'an.)
For innumerable aeons, since there has been self, this stink­
ing skinbag has been changed from time to time, transformed
from place to place, in a thousand conditions, ten thousand
forms; who can reach the realm of our fundamental quies­
cence?
If you get here, you must know this road. 'This road' means
while dwelling in the present heap of sound and form, first
getting rid of clinging to self, and attaining our former original
state of selflessness. And furthermore, you must know that all
things have no self. Once person and things are selfless, in your
daily activities you walk in the void. This life basically has an
undefiled practice and experience; thus would we practice and
experience nondefilement. Today you must diligently walk in
the void. Walking in the void is not some special art; each day
when you go into the hall, you should not chew through a
single grain of rice. Not chewing through a single grain of rice
means that there is no breaking of the fast or violation of disci­
pline by arousing mindfulness of tasting flavor. This is called
traveling the bird's path.
Travel on the bird's path is trackless; when you don't leave
your body in the realm of tracklessness, this is the turning
point of an ascetic. After you have arrived here and settled
here, there is still one road going beyond. This road is not in
going or coming; it is what is called 'moss growing in the jade
palace.' All the names of the Other Side are temporary names
for this. In reality, it is the one road that cannot be touched
upon. That is why we say 'hidden.' And 'hidden' is not a matter
of giving a name as its meaning; the realm called the hidden
road is the realm of no name or meaning. This is why it is said,
'He has no country; he does not abide, dwells in no home.'
634

Traditional Teaching Devices

635

To know this and yet be able to not remain here, to be an
example for beings, to inspire and lead them, unify and teach
them, is called 'extending the hands.' In extending the hands,
there is no separate roadi it does not transgress the bird's path.
Traveling the bird's path by yourself, yet you extend your
hands. In the bird's path there is no separate roadi knowing the
hidden road yourself, you still don't transgress it. Dwelling in
the bird's path, you don't sprout horns on your head but always
extend your hands.
Thus the three roads are the cause and effect of the great
practicei and the cause and effect spreads vast and wide
throughout the whole universe.

THREE KINDS OF FALL

(The following sayings are attributed to Ts'ao Shan Pen Chi, a
great desciple of Tung Shan, also known as the Former Ts'ao
Shani the remarks in parenthesis may be those of Ts'ao Shan
Liao Wu, known as Great Master Hui Hsia, a successor of Pen
Chi, known as the second generation Ts'ao Shan. There is a
certain amount of confusion as to the authorship of some early
Ts'ao-Tung works, but this is totally irrelevant to our purpose.)
An ascetic taking food has three kinds of fall: being a water
buffalo is the fall of an ascetici not accepting food is the fall of
the preciousi not cutting off sound and form is the fall accord­
ing to kind. Just falli whose business is this?
(If you want to know, this is going in among different kinds,
not approving the business of asceticism, purification, and
tranquilization. Therefore the Ancients provisionally used the
water buffalo to represent different kinds. But these are differ­
ent kinds in terms of phenomena, not speech.)
As for different kinds of speech, all speech back and forth is
of a kindi that is why Nan Ch'uan said, "Where knowledge
cannot reach, just don't speak of iti if you speak of it, then
horns will grow on your head. Even if you call it 'thus,' already
it has changed. You should just go work among different kinds
of beings." Right now you must go into differentiation and
speak of the phenomena in differentiationi only when there are
no words in your words will you be able to do so. When Nan
Ch'uan was ailing, someone asked, "Master, after you die,

636

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

where will you go?" Ch'uan said, "I'll be a water buffalo at the
house of the patron down the mountain." His questioner said,
"I want to accompany you, master, but can I?" Ch'uan said, "If
you follow me, come with a blade of grass in your mouth."
(These are words of an ascetic transforming himself; there­
fore he says, 'If you want to approach, come with a blade of
grass in your mouth.' To approach intimately is called 'Only
nonattachment is worthy of offering.')
He also said, "As for the fall according to kind, right now in
the midst of all sounds and forms, to turn oneself around on
everything and not fall into gradations is called falling accord­
ing to kind.
11

He also said, "As for the fall of the precious, the body of
reality and nature of reality are precious things; they too must
be turned around-this is the fall of the precious. Right now,
the White Ox on Open Ground is the ultimate model of the
body of reality; it too must be turned around, so that one may
avoid sitting in the region of uniformity with no discrimina­
tion. This is also called the business of cutting off offering. If
you want to use offerings, you must obtain this food. Thus it is
called flavorless flavor, and it is called nonattachment being
worthy of offering. All the rest is defiled food; it is not the food
of nonattached liberation. Someone asked Pai Chang, 'What is
used for food?' Pai Chang said, 'Nonattachment is used for
food.' Yun Yen said, 'Do not use flavor for offerings.' Tao Wu
said, 'Knowing there exists something to maintain, all is offer­
ing."'
Those who take food from correct livelihood must have all
three kinds of fall.
At the time, a monk asked, "Wearing fur and horns-what
fall is this? Not accepting food-what fall is this? Not cutting
off sound and form-what fall is this? I said, "Wearing fur and
11

horns is the fall of the ascetic. Not cutting off sound and form
is the fall according to kind. Not accepting food is the fall of the
precious-this is the fundamental thing; one knows it exists,
yet does not grasp it, so it is said, 'fall of the precious.' As for
wearing fur and horns, the fall of an ascetic, this is not clinging
to the business of asceticism, nor to the states of rewards of all
saints. As for not cutting off sound and form, the fall according
to kind, because a beginner knows he has his own fundamental
thing, when he turns back the light he gets rid of all form,

Traditional Teaching Devices

637

sound, smell, flavor, feel, and ideas, and attains stillness. Thus
after he perfects this accomplishment, he does not cling to the
six sense fields; falling among them, he is not befuddled, going
along with them without hindrance. Therefore it is said, 'The
six teachers of outside paths are your teachers; when those
teachers fall, you also fall along with them, and thereby can
eat.' The food is the food of right livelihood; it is also the
fundamental thing. It is just that not being defiled by the per­
ceptive awareness in your six senses is called 'falling'-it is not
the same as former fears. One does not even grasp his own
concern, the fundamental thing, much less anything else."

THE FIVE STATES OF LORD AND VASSAL

(The germ of the five states-or positions, ranks-is in the
Ts'an T'ung Ch'i, 'Merging of Difference and Identity/ written

by Shih T'ou (700-790L ancestor of the Ts'ao-Tung house.
Tung Shan exposed the five states in his Pao Ching San Mei Ke,
'Song of the Jewel Mirror Meditation/ and composed a set of
poems on the five states of the interrelation of the true/
absolute and biased/relative. Ts'ao Shan, who seems to have
used the five ranks more than Tung Shan's other disciples, had
been a scholar of Confucianism until the age of nineteen and
expressed the five states in terms of lord and vassal, or prince
and minister. The following is Ts'ao Shan's explanation.)
The absolute state is the realm of emptiness, where there
has never been a single thing; the relative state is the realm of
form, with myriad forms. The relative within the absolute is
turning away from principle and going to phenomena; the ab­
solute within the relative is indifference to phenomena, enter­
ing principle. Mutual integration is subtly responding to
myriad circumstances without falling into various existences.
It is not defiled, not pure, not true, not biased; therefore it is
called the empty mysterious great way, the non-grasping true
source. The past worthies since time immemorial have es­
teemed this rank (state of integration) as the most wondrous
and most mysterious. You must discern it clearly and
thoroughly. The lord is the absolute state, the vassal is the
relative state. The vassal turning towards the lord is the abso­
lute within the relative; the lord looking upon the vassal is the

638

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

relative within the absolute. The way of lord and vassal in
harmony is an expression of mutual integration.
A monk asked, "What is the lord like?"
The master said, "His wondrous virtue is honored through­
out the worldi his lofty illumination shines through the great
void."
"What is the vassal like?"
"His spiritual activity spreads the holy wayi true wisdom
benefits living beings."
"What is the vassal turning towards the lord?"
"Without falling into various dispositions, freezing his feel­
ings he gazes upon the holy countenance."
"What is the lord looking at the vassal?"
"Although his wondrous countenance doesn't move, the
shining of his light is fundamentally without bias."
"What is the way of lord and vassal in harmony?"
"Comingling, without inside or outsidei merging harmoni­
ously, with upper and lower equal."

FEN YANG ON THE FIVE STATES

(Fen Yang Shan Chao, 94 7-1024, was one of the great ancestors
of the Lin Chi house of Ch'an, noteworthy for his development
of the kung an as a tool in Ch'an studyi one of his points was to
show the unity of the essence of Ch'an in the midst of the
various methods which had evolved in the streams of Ch'an
teaching over the preceding three hundred years.)
Coming from within the absolute
The jewel sword of the diamond king
Sweeps the skies with a spiritual light;
It shines freely throughout the world, like a crystal,
Its clear radiance free of dust.

See the wheel-turning king;

Coming from within the absolute is lotus flowers blooming on
parched ground-their golden calyxes and silver stems are
bathed in jade dewdrops. The eminent monk does not sit on
the phoenix pedestal. The relative within the absolute-the
moon is bright at midnight, the sun must greet the dawn. The
absolute within the relative-a hair tip becomes a huge tree, a
drop of water becomes a river. Arriving in both-spirit does not
come from heaven or earth; how can heroism depend on the
four seasons for its impulse? Simultaneous realization-the
jade woman casts the shuttle on the whirring loom, the stone
man beats the drum, boom boom.

why bother to ask further of me?"
eliciting -someone asked Mu Chou, "What did the ancestral

consciousnesses-Refers to the fields and functions of con­
sciousnesses associated with senses, intellection, judg­
ment, and formation of habit, etc. Emotional conscious­
ness is states of mind, emotion, and intellection, which
are primarily influenced by emotions ('like' 'dislike' etc.,
which inevitably return to the attempt to preserve the
idea or feeling of self) and thus screened by such involve­
ments from clear perception of reality or truth.
demon-Representation of deluding or confusing forces, ob­

bing people of clarity, will, and the life of wisdom.
diamond king-The awakened mind; diamond is a symbol of

dragon-Someone who is enlightened or has reached an ad­

vanced spiritual degree; though 'dragons' live physically
in the 'animal' world, their profound state of meditation
allows them to transcend this condition and enjoy the
bliss of heavenly states or complete calm. Great Ch'an
adepts and students are often referred to as 'dragons and
elephants'-one who looks adept at first but turns out
otherwise is said to have a 'dragon's head but a snake's

Manfusri-The bodhisattva representing wisdom and knowl­

edge, depicted as riding on a golden lion (symbol of the
body of reality) and being the teacher of the seven Bud­
dhas of antiquity. Manjusri's image is the conventional
main icon of Ch'an meditation halls.
nirvana-Extinction of suffering, known as Peace, Liberation,
Bliss, the Other Shore, the Refuge, the Uncompounded,
etc. In early Buddhism nirvana was known as the correct,
or absolute state, and is the essence of sainthood.

but in Ch'an lingo anyone who seeks or grasps anything is

called an outsider, estranged from inherent enlightened
nature.
Patriarch-Ancestor; refers to living examples of enlighten­
ment; it can refer to the leaders or founders of branches of
Buddhism, and in Ch'an is also used as a term of respect
for adepts of earlier generations as well as the founders of
the streams.
patchrobe-An example and symbol of poverty, the clothes of

Buddhist ascetics were made of patched rags. This expres­
sion is also used in Sufism, with the same basic sense.
pillar and lamp -Being present in the teaching halls, the pillar

and lamp are often mentioned as examples and thus rep­
resentative of the objective world.
reed shade-A bundle of reeds used to shade sun off water so as

to be able to see beyond the surface into the depths-a
simile for tactics of a Teaching Master to draw out or see
into a student.
samadhi- One pointed focus of mind; concentration or ab­
sorption; sometimes extended in Ch'an usage to refer to
-

any state of mind, any activity, even phenomena.
Samantabhadra-Bodhisattva representing goodness and wis­
dom in all actions, the ultimate principle of union of
knowledge and myriad deeds for the enlightenment of all
beings;

Samantabhadra is depicted as riding on an

elephant. The vow of Samantabhadra closes the Gan­
dhavyuha, a major scripture contained in the grand A v­
atamsaka (Hua Yen) scripture; it bespeaks the ultimate

aspirations of those who conceive the will for universal
enlightenment.
South-A code word for Ch'an study ('going South') or en­

lightened knowledge itself; the journey of Sudhana for
enlightenment (which is the story of the Gandhavyuha)
was to the South and Ch'an flourished most in southern
China during its golden age in the T'ang dynasty-hence
the association came to be a fixed term.
Tathagata-An epithet of Buddhas, meaning one who has

come to realize thusness.
triple world- Three worlds; refers to the realms of desire,
form, and formlessness or immateriality.

THE BLUE CLIFF RECORD

turning word- Word or expression occasioning or representing

the transformation from delusion to enlightenment,
especially a term or phrase which contains both ordinary
and spiritual or transcendental meanings, both provi­
sional and real, or both negative and positive modes.
triple vehicle- Three vehicles; refers to the careers of disciple­

ship (following the Dharma to realize personal emptiness
and sainthood), self-enlightenment (solitary liberation
through understanding of the process of conditioning),
and bodhisattvahood (realization of both personal and
phenomenal emptiness and the conception of great com­
passion and commitment to the enlightenment of all be­
ings). These three vehicles lead into the so-called unique
vehicle, which is the way of complete Buddhahood.
Ts'ao Ch'i-A river and river valley in south China, where the

famous Sixth Patriarch of Ch'an taught; hence it comes to
be a codeword not only for that Patriarch, Hui Neng, but
for all the streams of Ch'an (and hence Ch'an itself, after
the ninth century) which were descended from Hui
Neng's enlightened disciples.
whisk-Used for nonviolent insect dispersal, its use was a pre­

rogative of abbots, so it came to be another symbol (and in
fact was physically handed down as such) of the succes­
sion of a Ch'an lineage; it is commonly used, however,
like the pillar and the lamp, as a representative symbol of
This, objective reality.
Vairocana- The great Sun Buddha, the Illuminator, the so­

called Adibuddha or primordial awakening, symbolizing
the body of reality. As a meditation ( dhyani) Buddha in
esoteric Buddhism, Vairocana is associated with mind
and may be said to represent the basic awakened intelli­
gence or the fundamental luminous quality of awareness.
The cosmos itself also may be said to be an attribute of
Vairocana.
